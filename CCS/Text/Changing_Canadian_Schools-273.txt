When chanﬁng hum mo acﬁvity to another, Sue almost

tothehighmtpointahecouldrewhsothatinteractzionwas
almost impmﬁhleorbemme a confrontation. She also t.-new
to interrupt and avoid the acﬁvity. Sue's attmtion span was
perceived to be short, so that planned acﬁvities were usually
simple, fast, and changﬁ oiten.
Ourﬁrsttaslt,then,wastodecidehowwe as agroupwere
going tochange the way weworked with Sue soas tobring
about the ch% we wanted — her willingness to participate
in a task. We made several decisions:
1. Tash would be simple one- or two-step procedures that
were not nwessarily academic in nature;
2. Each task would encourage Sue to orient herself with the
person helping her in the activity;
3. Verbal praise and encouraging touches would begin as
soon as the activity began and end only when the task was
completed;
4.. lfSue hesitated to engage in the activity, the adult would
begin the adivity and help Sue participate by placing the
materials in her hand;
5. The materials used would be solid objects which could be
passed easily from one person to another and which were
available in large quantiﬁes;
6. The activity would take plam wherever Sue happened to
be. Having interaction with Sue was most important;
where it took plam in the classroom was secondary. Should
she go to the other side of the mom, the materials would he
easily transported to her and that is where the teaching
would take place;
