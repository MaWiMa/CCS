but I will not let the [claamom] tmcher see that I am
upset or ﬁsstrawd.
Most schools have two teachers worﬁng in the M&R role.
They rely heavily on each other, sharing the trials and
frustrations of the position. At several schools where the M&R
teachers were interviewed, they diviﬁ the claw equally at
each grade level. For example, in one school sewing Grades 1
to 5, each M&R teacher took responsibility for two of the four
classm at each level. They said this keeps each teacher
involved with the whole curriculum of the school. It also
permits them to work as a team on curriculum questions, and
substitute for each other if necessary. The teamwork includes
frequent discussion of perspecﬁves on individual cam and
appropriate instructional stratemes:
We share theworh. That may wecan talk back and forth
and compare what zoehe done with diﬁhrent students.
Maybe something Foe done would be aseﬁd to her and
vice uersa. Teachers know which M&R teacher they
should go to, but sometimes in an emergency they talk
towhoeverthey mat. We take care of it. We often discuss
assessments. It's nice tohave that back up. someone who
can conﬁrm what you see. Itis alsogreat because we're
both familiar with all the kids and there are times when
we have tosit in on a meeting for the other M&R teacher.
In some schools M&R teachers work out of the same mom
and discuss things on an informal basis. In other schools, they
have formal meetings once a week where they discuss prob-
lems or issues. This seems more prevalent at the high school
than at the elementary level. One of the high schools reported
formal meetings each week that are attended by the three
teacher's aides as well as the two M&R teachers. They feel this
helm them discuss and resolve student and scheduling prob-
lems and deal with organizational issues.
