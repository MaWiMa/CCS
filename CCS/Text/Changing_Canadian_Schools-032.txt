ltis nowwagnized that learning problems are contextual.
They exist within the context of the O1  where the

The traditional appmch to special edtmation encouraged

instruction for the student (Little, 1985). The message
inherent was that regular class teachers were not qualiﬁed

The past heads has seen an inueasing number of school
districts make a commitment to full integration for all stu-
dents (Fmmt, 1984a; Forest, 1987). These range from several
Catholic school districts in southern Ontario (Little, 1985), to
French-loam ﬁstricts in Quebec(Frigon, 19B8),toseveral
public districts in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British Co-
