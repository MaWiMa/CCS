Support the Methods and Resource Teocl er
As stated previously, both the regular class and methods and
resource teachers need support from the school administrators
in implementing integration. lniﬁally, the methods and re-
source teacher may have to assist the regular class teacher in
a variety of ways such as by providing more planning time and
consultation. In order that this be carried out eﬂectively, the
principal should help with planning, organization and sche-
duling so that the classroom teachers can be released for
speciﬁc periods.
Many principals said they have found it important to select
methods and resource teachers who are able to assume some
leadership and to collahrate eﬂectively with staﬁ' and par-
ents. Prindpals also tend to rely on the expertise of their
methods and remorse teachers. As one principal stated, how-
ever, “Even though I rely on my methods and resourm teacher
to provide leadership in intepating our exceptional students,
I feel it is my responsibility to keep in close contact with her so
that I can provide the nemssary support.”
Assign Teacher Assistants
At the outset of many integration programs, teacher assis-
tants were oflen assigned to individual exceptional students.
As a result, the teacher assistants oﬁen took on “ownership”
of the exceptional students who were assigned to them.
Consequently, the classroom teachers’ role in educating these
exceptional students diminished and the students became
more and more isolated in the regular class.
In order to prevent this situation, the educators recom-
mended that the teacher assistant be assigned to the teacher
rather than the student. The teacher would then be responsi-
ble for making sure the teacher assistant helped the class in
a variety of ways and became an integral part of the class.
