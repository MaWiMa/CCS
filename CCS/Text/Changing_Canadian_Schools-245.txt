social life of the school. They have the chance to form and
maintain valuable peer relationships with their non-handi-
capped schoolmates.
Peer Thtoring
Another way teachers are enoouramng students to form rela-
tionships while assisting in each other’s learning is through
pmr tutoring. Teachers use this strateg eﬂectively in many
learning situations tbrouﬂout the school day. The simplest
approach is a system of peer partners who help each other in
a variety of ways: reviewing rote material; preparing for a
spelling test; learning math; or working together to correct
each other-’s assignments and edit essays. Pwr partners can
help each other synthesize and assimilate new material; for
example, they mu work together summarizing and sharing key
points in a'text.
Teachers also use the peer parmer system to motivate and
encourage students to try new things or to expand limited
skills. One example we omerved involved a young student
named Donnie in a Grade 4 classroom. Donnie sat with a peer
at a table. The peer was doing an exercise in his math notebook
while Donnie manipulated some plastic blocks placed on his
desk by the teacher. The peer used the blocks for assistance in
solving equations while Donnie used them to develop ﬁne
motor control, and to see and touch number groups.
At ﬁrst. Donnie knocked the blocks oﬁ' the table and his
peer partner bent and picked them up, arranging them in a
pattern. Donnie ignored the blocks. The peer piclmd up a block
and showed Donnie how to open it. He showed Donnie the
small plastic toy inside. The peer encouraged Donnie to pull
open the block by himself. Donnie pushed the blocks away.
Donnie’s peer then took a Cheezie from a bag in his desk,
showed it to Donnie and hid it inside the block. Donnie
struggled to open the block and, when successful, ate the treat.
The peer then showed him two blocks. “I have two blocks
now, Donnie,” he told him. “I'm going to put the Cheezie in one
