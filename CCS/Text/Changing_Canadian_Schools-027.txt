198%, the Integration Action Group was providing sophisti-
mted support to individual fa1mh' ‘m 8  to achieve‘
integration. Since 1987, the Centre ﬁr Integrated Education
(now mild the Centre for Intepated Education and Commu-
nity) has ban another source of t.rsi$'mng, eonstltation, and
resonrm devehpment for both parents and professionals.
Such initiatiim are unique to Canada and have helped give
parents the courage and determination to seek integrated
educational ﬁttings for their children.
Parents have insisted with considerable suws that the
tradiﬁonal special education system change. The inmessing
Mmand from parents has been evident in every pmvinoe and
territory and the concerns that have created the demand have
been oonadstent. Parents’ demand hr integrated edumtion
stems from a vim'on for their children's future which they only
see realized in a regular class with non-disabled mrs.
At a meeting for parenm of special needs children, we
were asked, ‘What is yourdream foryourchi1d?""I never
[thought]! hadadream for my son Danieiwho has
special needs  Aﬁer thinking about it, lhowever, I
realieed]IdohaveadrmmforDanieI—a very simple
drmrn I dream of Daniel taking an apple to his teacher,
ofpocking his lunch for school, ofsming him in a mhool
play, and of him bringing home his report card. These
are very ordinary things for most parents, but to the
family of a I mentally handicapped] child, these are
dreams that bring unexplained joy.
And I have another very special dream for Daniel that
is coming true right now. While a1_,ola;vgr0up, Zmnielis
friend Evan sits with him  I how when my son is in
high school, hisfriends will say, ‘mniel doesn"t need an
attendant all day -— we'll help him with his lunch -
we'll makesure hegets toclams—we’I1 help him toget
on and offthe bus. We?! take him to the school dances
