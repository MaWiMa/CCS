cooperatively. We found that IEPs were not necessary when
our son had good, experienced teachers who were committed
to integration. We have also known parents whose children
have had poor teachers despite IEPs.
A WORD OF CAUTION
Although our principles are simple, putting them into practice
is difﬁcult. Parents should be wary of people who promote
simple answers to the complex questions facing education
today.
One potentially dangerous cry is “back to the basim”. Any
education system built around the back-to-the-basim theme
will be system-centred and norm-referenced with no place for
exceptional pupils. Securing a decent education for
emmptional children means supporting integation, with all
the inherent challenges involved. It means supporting
theorim and practices that are called pmpessive, rather than
those that are called conservative.
It is also important to realise that our society asks the
impmsible of teachers and school administrators. We expect
them to resolve all our social pmblems and have all kinds of
programs such as AIDS and anti-racism education and
propaganda from the nuclear industry. Integration means
appropriate education for all pupils and is best accomplished
when teachers are not over-stressed.
Parents should support efforts to reduce class size,
eliminate cnniculum overload and impmve support services
for teachers; parents should also support rewards for
exceptional teachers. Parents must resist any postponement
of integration based on the excuse that the system is not ready.
lfthe time, eﬁort and money spent opposing integration were
spent implementing it, integration would be a reality.
System-wide integration can work; good teachers and
administrators have discovered that they can integrate
exceptional students much better than they thought possible.
