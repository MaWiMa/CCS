This author describes a new integration, namely, the integra-
tion of the specs] edumﬁon service system into a new, total
educaﬁon service system. He summarizes the legal basis for
school integration in the United States and makes a distinc-
tion between following the spirit and following the letter of the
law. Eight key administrative strategies are outlined for
facilitating a high quality education system for all students,
regardless of the presence or severity of handicap.
