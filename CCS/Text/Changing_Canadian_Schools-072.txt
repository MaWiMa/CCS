Prooi.nciallTerri-torial Responsibility
The Supreme Court of Canada has not had the opportunity to
rule on the question of whether there is a constitutional right
forallchildmntoattcndschoolintheirneighhourhoodina
regular class. The court has, however, stressed the importance
of the State providing an education to its citizens. The consti-
tution has conﬁnually made education the exclusive jurisdic-
tion of the provinm. It can be argued that, where the provin-
cial/territorial gowrnment bu undertaken through legisla-
tion to provide an education, that edumﬁon must be provided
without discrimination to meet the constitutional standard
unwed on provinces and territories by s. 15.
Legislation typically enables the education minister to
delegate responsibility for the day-to-day Mucation and ad-
ministration to school board ofﬁcials. In addition to holﬁng
school hoards accountable for the practice of segregating
children with mental disabilities, some parents have made
simultaneous claims against ministers of education who have
the ultimate statutory duty.
The recent settlement of the Charter challenge in Ontario,
H ysert v. Carleton Board ofEducation ct 01. , demonstrata the
importance of arserting a shared responsibility with the
provincial or territu. ial government. The case was settledjust
prior to trial when the attorney general advised counsel for the
