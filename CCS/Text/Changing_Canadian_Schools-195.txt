at a needing level below that of the reading material. The
diﬁculty is not in understanding the concept of conﬂict but in
reading the material in os-der to complete the assignment. By
plwbg emphasis on the ability to read and write without
allowing other means for demonstrating learning or illustrat-
ing knowledge of conﬂict, students one “handicapped” by the
stmctmo.
Instead of expmting all students to know the types of
literuy conﬂict and road all the material, the teacher can
approach this concept in a broader sense. If the when were
to mncentrate on acquainting all students with an under-
standing of conﬂict and have them identify the tym through
uamples in real life, the types could later he relatd to a
parﬁcular novel or short story. This would allow all students
to he involved in the conmpt while variations are made in the
assignments to accommodate different levels of skill.
