Tlopla Listening Skins
Grah: 3
Alter several listening activities, the teacmr realized that a
student with sgﬁal weds wm having serious diﬁculty with
the end. He constantly interrupted by mowing about the
class distraeting others. The teacher photocopied pictures
from the book she wm reading and had the student with
specialnewsplace the pictnrwontheboardatthe approm-iate
time using mmetic strip. At ﬁrst, she tappd a bell to
indimte when he was to plm the pietum on the chalkbmd.
The technique allowed for inclusion of the student as well as
keeping him on task. The student had become a valued
member of the class and was actually helping other students
to improve their listening skills. (Sherille Crouse, 1989)

Toplm Introduction to the province of Quebec
Grade: 5
The boundaries and important places in Québec were dis-
cussed. The students were expected to label these places on a
map using an overhead produced by the teacher. The student
with spedsl needs was assisted by assigned students. Lines
were drawn on the map within which the names ofplw were
printed. The spelling was checked by the students, who were
also expected to make notes about the places or events dis-
cussed. 'l'he important facts were written on the board to
provide a guide for the students to use for writing complete
sentences. The student with special needs listed the facts but
was not mmmible for writing the sentences. As a result, the
student felt a part of the lesson. He beneﬁtted from the lmon
by learning the main ideas and the clas heneﬁtted by learning
a study skill -- utilizing key facts to remember notes.
