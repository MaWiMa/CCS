Access to Equality in Education:
The Power of Parents
by S. Dulcie Mcﬁllum
Equality is new, not old. Until recently, there was no law or
mnstitution in Canada that ensured equality. Only when the
federal and provincial/‘territorial governments enacted hu-
man rights legislation and when, in 1985, the equality rights
provision, section 15, was proclaimed in the Canadian Charm"
of Rights and Fmedoms was there any legal authority for a
claim to equality.
Mental disability was not included in section 15 until the
ﬁnal draﬁ: of the Charter was drawn up. Then the proclama-
tion of the equality rights provision was delayed three years
after patriation of the constitution. This delay was to give
governments at all levels the opportunity to amend existing
legislati on to meet the constitutional equality imperative. All
jurisdictions now include protection in human rights legisla-
tion for people with mental handicaps hut it was not until 1990
that the last province made the necessary amendment.
