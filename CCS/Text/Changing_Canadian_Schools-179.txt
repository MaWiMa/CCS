Tﬁ TEACHER AND TE CLASSROOM
It has always ban a characteristic ofeducaﬁon that there has
never been enough time to get everything done. Today, even
with advanced technolog surrounding us, it seems that more
and more activitim are cutting into our precious minutes.
Each child needs tin e with the teacher, and mchers make
conscious eﬂbrts to interact with each student every day. But
we never feel that we have spent enough time with each
student.
This feelinq only increases when the class includm a child
with spedal needs. Because of their needs, they generally
require even more one-on-one attention.
