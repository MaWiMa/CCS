This article is written by a teacher who, with no special
training, integrated Susan, a student with handicaps, into her
Grade 5 clam. She documents her initial fears and
worrim about her ability to mmt Susan's various needs, and
about the md workload and the possible impact on the
mdemic propose of other students. Yet what orignﬁally
seemeda dauntingtaskevolves into a mutual learning ms
for all. The author learns to involve Susan in the general
program, make small adaptations to the curriculum, and
allow and encourage natural interactions with peers.

An Adapﬁve Learning Environments Model (A-LEM) was
implemented in ﬁve schools of a large urban school system as
a full-time mainstreaming pnopam. It was designed for stu-
dents with mild handicaps who had previously been served in
self-contained special education programs. While many gene-
ral education teachers had expected problems in dealing with
students with mental handicam, diﬂiculties were rare. Stall‘
development was identiﬁed by participating teachers as a key
factor in the program's success.
The authors call for renegotiation of the roles of both
general and special education staff. They see general educa-
tion teachers acting as the primary instructors for all students
and special education teachers providing consultation and
special instruction as needed in the classroom.
