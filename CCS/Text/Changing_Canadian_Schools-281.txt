Awakenings (1982), documented the 1988 students’ strike at
Gallaudet University inwashington, the world famous liberal
m'ts college for the deaf. In March of that year, when the
prmidential vacancy was about to be ﬁlled, the students
mmpaigned to have the ﬁrst deaf president in the school's 124
year history. According to Sachs’ eye-witness account, in
selecting the only hearing candidate and ignoring the depth of
conviction on this issue, the authorities were amused of being
paternalistic, of holding values based on an implicit view of
incompetence and of appearing to believe “that deaf people
should be printers, or work in the post oﬁce, do ‘humblejohs’
and not aspire to higher education” (Sachs, 1989).
Despite these attitudes, inclusive post-secondary educa-
tion is making headway in Canada. A community college in
Toronto, a uriversity in Edmonton and a CEGEP(wmmunity
college) in Montreal have been including students with mental
handicaps for several years now.
I was Cwrdinator of the I-lumber College Community
lntegmtion through Cooperative Education (CICE) program
in Toronto, Ontario, from 1984 to 1990. The program was
desi@ed to support educational opportunities at college for
individuals with a mental handicap - the people for whom the
college doors had previously been shut.
As coordinator of the new program, I was immersed in the
ideologr and culture of the college, learning about its history
and values, and listening to the language of education. I
became convinced that these students truly belonged there.
THE HUMBER PROGRAM: A STEP ON THE
CONTINUUM OF INTEGRATION
A walk through I-lumber College on any given day reveals a
noisy, animated and colourful scene. Private conversations
compete with aspiring DJs on the student radio station. A
preponderance of denim, '1‘-shirts and leather set the overall
fashion tone. French fries and Diet Coke provide daily suste-
