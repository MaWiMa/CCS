Personal Qualities
What qualities should an M&R teacher have? The overriding
opinion is that a person developing durational programs for
students with special needs in regular classrooms must be
optimistic and have a pmitive approach, particularly to their
expectations of the student with a disability.
It is also necessary to have conﬁdence that teachers
inexperienmd in teaching stu&nts with spedal needs will
respond to the challenge. Many classroom teachers have been
told for years that students with disabilities require apedal
instruction frm special educators. That thinking is not eaaiiy
changed and calls for the M8-.R teacher tohe naturally optimist
and positive in difﬁcult situations.
Persistence is msential. “You have to be willing to go the
extra mile, willing to spend a little bit of extra time, a little bit
of extra energ or effort to get ahead and do what has to be
done. Longer hours, meetings wmever the parent is available

M&R teachers have to work with a large number of people:
teachers, administrators, consultants, and parents. The abi-
Hty to work well with others and to handle interpersonal
relationships etiectively is another important part of the job.
One teacher described this as “accepting people as they are and
not trying to change them entirely over to your way of doing
things.” One teacher observed that she had to learn to actmlm
and easy-going and to be open to different styles of operating.
Her work as a regular class teacher had not prepared her for
this and it required considerable adjustment. There are many
ditferent personaliﬁes in a school, each reacting in their own
way to the sngestions made by the M&R teacher. The need
to balance these mnsiderations against the need to push for
changes and new approaches for the student makes the
position dimcult:
