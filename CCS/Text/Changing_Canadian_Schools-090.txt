Parent-teacher-admmistrator cooperation is important in the
formulaﬁon of the curriculum or program fur the pupil with a
mental handicap. If a pupil with a mental handicap is fox-ed
to follow the same curriculum as pupib without a mental

for cooperation is the Individual Edumtion Plan (IEP).
IEPs were originally introduced in the United States
because teachers leaked experience in teaching exceptional
pupils and it was deemed nmary toimpme amechmism to
ensure parent involvement and teacher accountability. In
that context, IEPs were a producﬁve mechanism, and they can
still he helpful. They provide a means of measuring what an
exceptional pupil learns, making it more ditﬁcult to blme the
pupil if thing do not go well.
An ﬁ should he drawn up carefully and cooperatively but
without heming a major production. The regular classroom
teacher may sometimes want to turn to a resomm person for
advice on the program and its implementation, and the parent
may want to turn to another experienmd parent. The pupil can
often he involved. In exceptional cases, a psychologist or even
a doctor may be involved.
The IEP is reviewed and revised cooperatively at regular
intervals and should M treated as a guide, not a straitjacket.
It also does not guarantee that all will suddenly be well; in fact,
educational crimes have been committed against pupils in the
name of IEPs.
An IEP is best viewed as a conﬁdence-building mechanism
for the parent, the teacher and the administrator, and the
pupil. The parent and teacher must he honest and realistic.
Parentscan tell the teacher how the pupil learns best, what he
is interested in, how he reacts in particular situations, how to
avoid problems, and so on. If things go wrong or there is
dissatisfaction, all mncerned must avoid any temptation to
blame someone, and instead concentrate on ﬁnding solutions
