intemt in what the students are mtually learning in class;
they claim to see the social value of integration, but they can't
always he certain about the educational value. Standards for
student evaluation and suws will new to be hveloped but
the challenge is to make them particular to each student and
each individual propam.
That raism another looming issue: padm. All tudents
want to be mded on their work. But when support is given to

tash thmlves are tanp'bly altered, questions about the
validity and comparability of grades inevitably arise. The
instruct-or who gives a student sixty-ﬁve per cent on a photo-
graphy assignment but who admits that he helped the student

hooks for appropriate support; other people allege bias.
Perham evaluations could he comprised of written com-
ments only, applauding accomplishment and pointing out
areas yet to he mastered. Or they could be a numerical grade
measuring the distance between where the student started
from and where they have reached.
Another challenge is graduation. Eventually, the college
may choose to hold a ceremony in which students paduate
with their peers and receive a modiﬁed diploma indicating
their partidpation and achievements.
There is always a sense of urgency in overcoming these
ohstaclm for people with disabilities because so much time has
already been wasted. Dr. Robert Gordon, president of Hum-
her, reﬂected aﬁer sis years of integration:
It is good for the college because in a funny sort of way
we are a disparate group of departments and
specializations. This P"°8"°"% in its awn way, has
forced an interaction and integration of our own people
in a way that was never happening before. There is a
mutual topic ofdiscassion and a very rewarding one at
that. So I think that in its unique fashion, in its own
