ofthat time we have been anxious to ﬁnish it. At the some ﬁme
we have been pleased that our contributors have had more
time to update their material based on their continuing
involvement in integrated education  Most of the
contributm'sarefrornNew Brunswick and thereasonsforthis
must be noted. First, since one of the ditors is from New
Brunswick, personal knowlwge of the people working in this
ﬁeld was a factor. Second, experience with integrated educa-
tion as a result of legislative and policy initiatives is unique in
the province, giving educators and parents substantial expe-
rimm which they have shared in this me.
Aspecial word cfthanksis duetoDr. G. Michael Fullan,
Deanof the Faculty oﬂlducation, University of‘I‘oronto, forhis
generomty in writing the preface to this book. His words of
support for the appwhes put forward are encouraging
reinforcement for pmple engaged in the strugle towards
inclusion. Hiswordsareall themorepowerfulbecauseheis
ed internationally as a leader in understanding edu-
cational change.
A heartmlt thank you goes to Laura Code, Publications
Editor at The Roeher Institute for her cheerful but persistent
prmpﬁng and motivation, without which the hook would
never have been completed. All the oonuibutors deserve
recognition both for their valuable additions to the wok as well
as for their Willingness to rework their material in order to
produce a balance between the chapters.
We hope the strategies and practical suggestions pre-
sented in Changing  Schools will be useful to fami-
lim and educators alike. Their eﬂbrts will promote the inclu-
sion of pwple with disabiliﬁes in all aspects of community life,
and improve the education system for all students.
