Inclusive Education as
Social Policy
by Diane Richler
The pressure to provide education for children with mental
handicaps began a half century ago when mnmrned parents
banded together because they wanted their children with
mental handicaps to remain at home, to be educated in the
community and to be kept out of institutions. From the
mention ofspaal educational classes for a few children grew
a vision of inclusion for all individuals who have been called
mentally handicapped, in all aspects of community life. This
vision included full participation in regular classes in
neighbourhood schools. That eﬁort has converged, both in its
goals and in its vision of the rights of all people, with two
broader societal trends. One is the movement towards the
equality of all citizens, which is creating awareness of a new
Canadian society —one that embraces diversity in all aspects
of life. The other is the trend for educational reform which is
causing both the public’-at-large and educators to reformulate
the educational system.
