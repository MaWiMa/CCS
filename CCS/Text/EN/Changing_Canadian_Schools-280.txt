On Campus: Integrated
Post-Secondary Education
by Mc*l0Ri£ PERI‘-Rh
The drive to hvelop integrated post-secondary education is
part of a historical and continuing struggle to include people
with disabilitiw in their natural communities with full rights
of citizenship. They have the same needs as everyone else to
further their education, to enhance their personal competen-
cies and to contribute to society. Post-semndary education is
one of the means by which their needs can be met.
However, in many ways both subtle and overt, some
students have been told that they don"t belong on campus.
College and university courses and programs were, until very
recently, mmpletely overlooked as potential opportunities for
persons with a mental hanﬁcap. This lack of expectation has
repercussions. When the situation does arise that a person has
an opportunity to select courses, the act of choosing becomes
a problem bwause the person likely has never been asked to
think about what he or she wants to do after high school.
Carwr oounmlling is not available to all students in secondary
schooland certain students are not among the targeted group
that colleges and universities work to attract.
