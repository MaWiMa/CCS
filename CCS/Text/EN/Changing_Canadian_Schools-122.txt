Training
M&R teachers generally said they thought personal and
pr0omskillsthatunderlietheworkoftheM&Rteacher
should he prmnt when the position is assumed. Organiza-
tional and interpersonal skills, as well as a sensiﬁvity to
student's needs and the htermination to solve pnblems, are
all  that are diﬂicult to teach.
Speciﬁc skills mlated to completing amessments, writing
IEPs and dewloping curriculum howledge are more easily
acquirml on the job. A commitment to personal development
md self-improvement is obviously a great advantage to some-
one working as a methds and rwource teacher:

lums so that I can modify them. I be had to develop my
own system of modiﬁcation. The best training is experi-
ence. Thais theonly way. You don’: develop an intuitive
feeling about something unless you 've bod experience
doing it. I ‘he learned mos: ofwhatl do day-today on the
job.
When school districts 28 and 29 instituted the position of
M&R teacher, a xormal training plan was developed. It in-
cluded individual work with teachers and half-day or full-day
group training sessions held every other week. Outside con-
sultants have been used on occasion, but most of the training
has been carried out by district staﬁ including the original
methods and resource teachers themselves.
Training focuses on developing an understanding of the
philosophy of an intepated program and the role of the M&R
teacher in supporting the prom. Training in collaborative
skills is particularly useful as these skills are critical in
establishing the right relationship with the classroom teacher.
