CLARE UNDE HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISIATION

provincial or territorial edumtion legmlaﬁon, some peome
have made complaints under human rights. Two factors bring
education under the domain of human rights: 1) despite
conﬂicting legal judpents. schools have been held to be a
public service or facility under human rights legislation; 2) in
all provinces and territories, mental and physical disability
are prohibited pounds for discrimination. Anti-dism'imina-
tiou laws mu addrm policy and practice of people and organi-
zations within both the public and private secwrs.
The basis of a complaint is that it is discriminatory to
segregate children because they have a mental disability in
self-contained, “special” schools or claurooms, as this denies
them amen to a public facility or service (the school) that is
customarily available to the public it serves (children).
The ﬁmt human rights complaint involving a child with a
mental handicap that went to a hearing, was initiated on the
basis of religous discrimination. The Catholic school board in
the county ofl.-snark, Leeds and Grenville in Ontario required
all children with mental handicaps to attend one class oper-
ated by a secular school board. This meant that Catholic
children with a mental handicap wuld not nemive instruction
in a semrate school in the religion of their choice. The
arrangement made between the boards dictating that all
“special nwds” children would he educated at one site was
done for administrative convenience.
