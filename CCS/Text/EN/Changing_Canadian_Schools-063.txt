The miﬂnal IQ tats. developed by Binet in 1904, had the
expms and limited purpose “'... d‘ identifying children whose

that  couldbs augmenmd by cdumtion dmignw to
cater to the speciﬁc needs of the child. His thrw principla for
using his tests were:
1. The scores are apractical devise; they do not buthws any
theory of intellect. They do not deﬁne anything innate or
permanent. We may not demgnate what they measure as
“intelligence” or any other reiﬁed entity.
2. The scab is a rough, empiriml guideforidentifyingmildly
retarded and learmj-disabled childrm who need spedal
help. ltis not a deviceforrankingnormalchildren.
3. Whatever the cause of diﬁculty in children identiﬁed for
help, emphasis shall be placed upon improvment thmugh
spmal training. Low scores shall not be used to mark
children as iunately incapable. (Gould, 1981)
These principles were disregarded as the use of IQ and
other standardized testing became popular over the next
eighty years. Since Binet’s time, IQ and other standardized
mting ha been used to exclude children from mgularclssses,
to place them in restricted environments, to deny them jobs,
to sterilize them, to prevent their immigation, and to place
many other restrictions on their social and economic partici pa-
tion.
legitimizing the value of intelligence (and education - an
achieved rather than an ascribed characteristic) has made it
possible to attach notions of merit to social order. Meritocracy
is simply a process by which society ﬁves out its rewards to
those who have merit.
The critical question is: who or what is worthy of merit?
