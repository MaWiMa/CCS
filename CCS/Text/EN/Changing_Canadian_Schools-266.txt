could not take French, commenting that “all we do in French
is repeat words - Sue can do that.‘ Her observations had an
underlying truth which few adults could explain away or
ﬁscount. Consequently, Sue had opportunitim to participate
in activities which adults would have considered irrelevant or
in conﬂict with her program. For instance, Sue previously had
to miss French so that she would haw extra time to get ready
to go home on the bus. Kerri felt that Sue was as able as any
student toget ready in the allotted ten minutes. And, given the
opportunity, Sue was able.
Another student, Scott, also became Sue's advocate. He
smmed to be more in tune with Sue’s needs than other peers.
Over the year, he went from being a volunteer to being truly
fond of Sue. His commitment to support Sue turned into a
friendship. For Scott, the experiences around helping Sue
enlarged his vision of friendship and e. pended his active
contribution to the school community.
For some students, being in the support group provided
them with a relationship which compensated for some ahence
in their lives. Each of us has primary relationships with
mrents or siblings which are a major sotmce of nurturing, love
and acceptance. Some students, because of divorce, alcohol
abuse, or other situations, have had terrible experiences with
some sigiﬁcant relationships. These students oﬁen become
lonely and attention-seeking. This was the situation for some
of the students in Sue's peer group; they were eager to
overcome their limited success with meaningful relationships
and become involved again. This seemed to spark their inter-
est in Sue's group. Over time, other students found the gnoup
comfortable to be in.
The commitment made by students generally seen as
loners and troublemakers surprised teachers. One teacher
said, “I would never believe that this person would ever
volunteer to help.”
