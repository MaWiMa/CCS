any children with special needs in her Brownie pack. She
repliM,"No”. ‘l‘hemrsonas.ked,"'Well don't you have Mandy?”
The Brownie leadm-‘s response was, “Yes, but she doesn’t have
spedal mﬁs. She’s just Manh.”
Intepation has helped Mandy to see herselfas part of the
whole. Her Grade 1 teacher told me that one day, during math
class, Mandy sudﬁnly stood up md literally pickﬁ up her
desk. She rnovd it ﬁom the last row by the door to the front
row in the middle of the classroom. At the beginning of the
period, the Eds had ban asked to move their desks into
groom, but, with good intentions, Mandy's desk had been
positioned so that she would not have to move. As the teacher
stood there smchless, a little boy at the back of the class put
up his hand and said, “Don't be mad at Mandy, she just feels
lett out.”
We quickly realized what Mandy was trying to tell us
through her actions. In her own way she was showing us that
although she was physically integrated she still felt special or
diiferent, an outsider. The other kids recmnized this and
spoke up on her behalf. Mandy’s desk remained in the middle
of the classrcom,in the ﬁnnt row, fortherest ofthe school year.
The incident also illustrates how Mandy’s participation has
enhanced the other children’s learning procems, providing a
creative, accepting, learning environment for every child. In
fact, all students have beneﬁtted in many ways from a uniﬁed
school system in which all learning needs are readily ad-
dressed. The supports and resources provided through inte
gration, such as the methws and resource teachers, teacher's
aides, peer tutors and cooperative learning groups, are provid a
ing valuable assistance to all students in the classroom.
A WAY OF LIFE
Mandy has been accepted and made to feel comfortable and
welcome and that she mlongs in her neighbourhood and
community. She is now recognized as Mandy: a cute little girl
