Partial Participation
In the area d‘ method of student practice, parﬁal participation
is an important mnoept. Students with very limited academic
ability can still be involved in activities in the class, based on
their speciﬁc ohjecﬁvm.
A student may be placw in a group in order to mat

knowledge about aparﬁcularsuhject. Examples of inclusion d
students with special needs are found in sample lessons on

Specific Strategies
Cooperative learning is an excellent strateg to consider when
choom'ng a method of student performance (Johnson, Johnson
and Holubec, 1984). It amommodates partial participation by
students who cannot do all the required work It allows for
social skill development and cooperation among all students,
as well as providing a choim of activities that will utilize the
various levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Cooperative learning, as
a strateg, cute acrms two steps in the multi-level insn-uction
process -- the method of teacher presentation and the method
of student performance.
The discovery approach is another strateg which mvers
both teacher presentation and student performance. If the
students, for example, are expected to discover the rules for
punctuation by compleﬁn g an activity initiated by the teacher,
the method of teacher presentation is student discovery and
the method of student practice is also dismvery.
