GUIDELINE FOR DEVELOPING PEER GROUPS
Peer groups are as unique as the individual studenm in them.
There is no one way of forming groum, but here are some
points worth consideration:
1. Students need to be asked to particimte in solving prob-
lematic situations. They quickly learn tobecome passivein
an adult-centrw world which tries to solve all their prob-
lems for them.
2. The class may need to be involved in discussions and reach
a consensus that there is a problem for one of the students.
For someone with spedal needs it could he an issue of
inclusion. For the at-risk student it could be st:-atep'es to
help the student attend clams. For the student who just
moved to the school it can be how to make them feel
welcome. By ﬁscussing and comparing prior experiences
to the current problematic situations, students will come
to see that they already know solutions. For example,
students can be encouraged to examine how a stranger is
made welcome in their home. In the process Of 
the gap between the way things are and the way they
should be, children come up with rich alternate strategies.
This process brings out values of equity that the children
know about but may never have acted on before. It pm-
vides the peer group with a rationale and may beneﬁt all
students who lack adequate peer support and inclusion, not
just the student in qumtion.
