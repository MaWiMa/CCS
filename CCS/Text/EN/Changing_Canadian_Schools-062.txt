THE REAL RESSAGE OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
What then is the real message m‘ an education system which
is dmed to value things that persons with mental handi-
mps cannot do, and which then claim them unedumble?
Inherent in its attitude is a presumption about the
incamcities of persons with mental handicaps. In addition,
thm is an implied expectation that persons with a mental
handicap will not be in regular puuic schools or particimnts
in the community in general. It is not surprising that the
person with a mental handicap has problems functioning in an
environment based on these assumptions — an environment
created with no consider-aﬁcm of their abilitiesorparticipation.
In the heyday of social darwinism and the eugenim move-
ment, education hecame the basis of qualiﬁcation for entrance
into elites, and the school system became the certifying
agency. Science thought it had found a way to quantify and
measure people’s intelhgence. Science seemed to provide ob-
jective uiteria which justiﬁed selective partidpation, entitle-
ment and rights — which, in fact, lemtimized a system of
dismimination. A rationale was created for particular disﬁnc-
tions and labels, which could have a medical and professional
basis rather than a soda] basis.
We nowknow that science is unabletocornpletely quantify
intelligence. However, standardized testing and narrow cur-
riculum persist in disentitling some people and restricting
their opportunities to participate. Gould, in his classic work,
The Mismeosure of Man (1981), claims that we continue to
assign to intelligence a whole set of complex human capabili-
ties that support “.... the [recognition of] the importance of
mentality in our lives and wish to characterize it, in part so
that we can make the divisions and distinctions among people
