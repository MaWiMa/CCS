STEP THREE:
@THODS OF STUDENT PRACTICE AND
P%ORMANCE
The third step in the four-step pws for mulﬁ-level instruc-
tion is determining the method of student performance. The
method of performance that the student utilim to show he or
she understands the concept tauﬂt should follow the some
variations discussed under method of presentation. There
should be an allowance for assignments haed on varying
modes of learning, assipments based on diﬂerent levels of
Bloom's Taxonomy, and assipments that show parﬁal par-
ticipation. This will allow students who would not be able to
read a story, for example, to be tanﬁt the concept of setting
and to complete assi@ents to illustrate this understanding.
Assignments might be oral or written, or involve drawing or
acting. If the main objective is to have all the students
understand setting, it cm he reached in many ways, all of
which are mually valuable.
In allowing for diﬁerent methods of student performance,
perhaps the most fundamental issue is the idea of choice.
Students must be allowed a variety ofdiﬂerent ways to show
that they understand a concept. This involves an acceptance
that the written word is not the only way of expressing
understanﬁng. It also involves instilling in students an ac-
ceptance that other ways of expressing understanding of a
