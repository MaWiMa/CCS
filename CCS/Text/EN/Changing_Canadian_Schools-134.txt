Out-of-Classroom In... ‘motion
Very httle pull-out instruction is occurring in the schools of
New Brunswick districts 28 and 29, and M&R teachers feel
that very little out-of-class instruction is required. Most of
them do very little of it, only twenty to thirty rninutu a day,
three or four days a week, according to the time-use survey(sw
page 145). Only one teacher had a student out of regular class
for longer --- six-and-a-half hours out of a twenty-ﬁve-hour
instructional wmh Instead, small group instruction is often
carried out in the regular classroom with the M&R teacher or
teacher's aide. Considerable use ofpeer-tutoring has lessened
the nwd for pull-out or out-of-class instructhn.
Individual or small group instruction is most frequently
needed for reading and other areas of language arts, or when
a student is being easily distracted. Teachers described in-
stances where the special needs student was distzracﬁng other
students from their work and was taken from the class for a
short period of time to get the behaviour under control before
returning to the classroom.
Community-based instruction programs also involve time
out of class. These include community access activities like
going to the library, the bank, the post otﬁce, or going out to
a testament with an adult. In most cases, e teacher’s aide
accompanies the student.
