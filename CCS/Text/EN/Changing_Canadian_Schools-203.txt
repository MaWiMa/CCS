When students are presented with a variety of assign-
ments at varying levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, the nwd for
enrichment as well as modiﬁcation can be met. Most students,
when p’-ven the choim of assipments, Wm select one that is
appropriate. However, there are two notes of caution:
1. Some students will choose the activities which are the
easiest for them, u they may nothe highly motivated. This
can he monitored by having students maintain a chart
showing their choice of assignments in various units as
they are covered. Restrictions can be placed on the number
of activities a student may do from a particular unit.
2. Students may feel they are unable to do certain activities
and, because they never choose them, they never have the
opportunity to improve their skills in that area.
A student's choice of assignments should reﬂect a reasonable
balance between the ow to succeed for motivational purposes
and need to learn new skills for the purpose of future success.
