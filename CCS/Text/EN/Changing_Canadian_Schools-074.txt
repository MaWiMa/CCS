Human Right: Complaint Mechanism Foil to Respond
The numhu of complaints to human rights mmissions has
powninrecentyearswithlittleincremeinthairﬁmding.The
resulﬁng backlq means there are many unresolved com-
plaints of edumtional discrimination. The tragedy of the
m'tuation is that human rights complmt mechanisms have
not pmducd the swift, amfble justice they were meant to
movide. The result is that some children mntinue to he
retained in segregated settim, tauﬂt at home or placed by
theirparentsinaltemativeschoolsasinterim measures while
a complaint is being procened.
It is impmmhle to mlculate the long-term dami to
children who have been denim the academic and social bene-
ﬁtsofregularclasses andwhohavsbeenostradzedinfcmtof
theircommunities. Twoglaiingexamplm ofthis unacceptable
situation are the Becky Till o. North York Schoo.' Board case,
a complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Commission, and
the Zebrowski v.  School Trustees ease, acomplaint
to the Manitoba Human Rights Commisdon.
Even where a mmplaint is investigated, idiosyncrmies of
the diﬁerent human rights mmismion oﬁces sometimm
impede justice. In a recent demhion following an investigation,
the P.E.I. Human Rights Commission alluded to discrimina-
tion but did not appoint a bmrd of While the commis-
sion directedintegraticn to take place, they did not spedfy how
or when the school board was to carry out the integration, and
failed to indicate how they intended to monitor the action of the
hoard in light of the dedsion. The letter to the mmplainant
advising her of the result indicated that if no steps were taken
by the school board, she could advise the commission ad-
ingly and it would intervene.
On the other hand, them are numerous examples in
various provinces and territories where the human rights
commission has assumed a role in arbitrating a settlement
and the matter has been resolved in favour of the child.
