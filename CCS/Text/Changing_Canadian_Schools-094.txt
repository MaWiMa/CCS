with diﬂerences did not belong in our community; they be-
longed somewhere else, some mam “speml”.
That belief was ﬁrst shaken in 1979 when, in a Canadian
hmpital in Inhr, West Germany, a beautiful baby girl with big
blueeym andbrown hairwasbcrnintoourfamily. Wecalled
her Mandy.
Scwral days following Mandy's birth, my husband and I
received shocking news. The doctors suspected that Mandy
hadbeenbornwith anertrachrommme or, asitishtter
known, Down Syndrome. My head spun. How could it be?
With apoundmgheartlhurriedbacktcmymom tocuddle
my long-awaited baby girl and stare at the face I almdy loved
so dearly. As lheld her close, I tried to imagine what the future
would hold for our f zmily. All I new was thatl was her mother
and she belonged with me. A nurse soon advised me to put my
baby down as I was becoming much too attached to her. She
said, “It wouldn't do either of you any good”. Her words leﬁ me
fmling angry, confused, defensive and alone.
It was several weeks before I found the courage to phone
my parents to inform them of the birth cf their ﬁrst pand-
daugbter. I was unprepared for their total acceptance of
Mandy. Their support and acceptance were invaluable in
helping me cope at that moment and in the years to come.
I feel fortunate that we had the foresight to reject the
advice of the doctors -— and the beliefs ofour generation — and
refuse to institutionalize our child. I will never regret the
decision which set my family on a challenging road ﬁlled with
obstacles.
In the years to come Mandy herself would challenge us all.
She would have a powerful impact on our lives and on the
direction we we .d take together as a family. As the mother of
a child labelled mentally handicapped, I would have to con-
tinually give erplanations, challenge convenﬁonal dedsions
and advocate for her rights. Mandy forced me to look for
answers, to make choices and decisions. The very people I
nespected and admired in life became my adversaries. Mandy
