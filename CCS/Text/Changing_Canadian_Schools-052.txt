For many individuals, the label “mental handimp” was
appliw when they enterﬂ the scmol system. Once in a
segregated school system, rnmt students were guaranteed a
future of continued segregation. Graduation ﬁ'om the
sepegated mhool meant entering a shelterﬁ workshop and
often moving into a group home. Few would ever have the
opportunity tornoveon ﬁnm a shelterﬁ workshop into ajob
in the workforce, and people living in group homes see them as
another institution (Park, 1991).
Participation in the regular classroom gives students who
have e ﬁsahility the opportunity to escape the cycle of
segregation. They break the cycle in three ways: they acquire
skills which make their mrticipation more meaningful; they
develop relationships which foster true membership in the
community; and their presence teaches other people how to
accommodate the surrounding environment to their
diﬁerences.
Perhaps the most important aspect of participation in an
integrated setting is that learning takes place in an
environment which provides its own rewaris and measures of
success. Parents and teachers from across Canada
conm'stently report that students who more from segregated to
integrated systems demonstrate improvements in
communications sﬁlls, concentration sﬁlls and demeanour.
Teachers report that non-disabled students are otten the
mmt meative in helping to accommodate the needs of a peer
who has a disability. Children are able to communicate
without words, see wheelchairs as toys, perceive challenges as
games.
The citizenship of students who have a mental handicap
is already being enhanced through the elimination of
segregation. As a part of their edumtion, students with
dmabili ties are learning about their rights and responsibilities
