right from the beginning. Students would automatically he
plam in their age-appropriate class and, through direct
experienm and training, the teachers would become less
tearful and would change their attitudes.
For the most part, teacmrs felt that actually having an
excsmal stuknt intemted in their class had changed
their attitudes and provided new learningexperiences. As one
teacher described it, “Integration is in-service, uni learn-
ing from the exceptional child’ Anotha teachu stawd, “Inte-
gration is a catalyst for other things; now I look at working
with other Eds, lib gifted and many others who are out of the
mainstream in my class.’
There was agrwment, however, that to ensure the full
beneﬁts of an intepated propam, the school administrator
should be responsible for providing support to the teacher.
Initially this support might include release time for the
teacher to plan, consult and attend in-service training, and
provim'oms for helping the teacher directly in the classroom
through a methods and resource teacher, a teacher assistant,
and student and parent voluntmrs.
Teachers with experience in integration wanted their
coll? to try an intepated classroom and know that it was
acceptable to make mistakes. Many teachm-s felt that they
learned through experience bemuse their principals had al-
lowed them to try diﬁenent ways of integrating students.
Allow for Transitional Planning
Planning the student’s tranudtion from separate to integrated
settings was seen as an important strategr in the integration
pm. Planmj should begin before an exceptional student
enters school or at the end of the previous school year.
Princiml support and involvement help make transitional
planning run more smoothly and eﬂectively.
Release time should he arranged so teachers receiving an
integrated student have adequate time to observe, meet with
the parents and current teachers, and prepare for the student.
