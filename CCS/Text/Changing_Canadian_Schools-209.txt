CONCLUSON
Because teachers are now responsible for a pester diversity
of students in regular clmms, a wider range of teaching
strategim is needed to mwt the needs cfthese students. As the
integmtion of students with spechl nmds has evolved, inclu-
sion has become a major concern. Multi-level instruction is a
teaching method which allows teachers to meet the individual
needs of students and provide quality education for all. This
will not he easy to do, nor will it happen quickly. However, if
inclum‘on of all is to he a characteristic of the education system
in the future, there must be commitment to the development
of multi-level instructim. 'l'hat will require a commitment to
the ideolog and a commitment to providing the resources
needed for its implementation. Both students and the educa-
tion aystem will achieve a higher level of success as a result.
