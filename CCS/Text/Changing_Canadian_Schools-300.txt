In this poliq analysis paper, education legislation in Ontario
is analyzed from several perspectives including its mandate
and authority, underlying values, and issues of implementa-
tion and outcomes. The paper concludes that new policy
options need to be considered which are strongly grounded in
the principles of the rights of the child, integration of all
children, and muality of access to educational opportunity.

Noting that ‘integated settings are on the increase all across
the country,” this article promotes individualized programs
and the discontinuation of a special, segregated education
system. Three school boards in Ontario are identiﬁed as
implementors of fully integrated systems and their success is
largely attributed to committed administrators. Problems
with integration are characterized as ones of injustice which
belong to school boards and not to individual children.
