Another consideration in pmmting the lesson should be the
involvement of students at their own level. This requires the
use of Bloom's Taxonomy in the development of questions and
assignments. Bloom's Taxonomy, or other m‘mYle.r structures
that indimte levels of thinldng, am useful in structuring
questionstoaskstudents at various levels. All studentscan be
involved in the lesson if suitable questions are developed to
allow their involvement. Although Bloom's Taxon omy is well
known, it is utilized lm than would be expmed fo r preparing
quwtions and assignments for students. The chart that fol-
lows indicates the levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, deﬁnes each
level. lists key verbs used to ask students questions, and lists
products or acﬁvities that students could produw or perform
at the indicated level.
