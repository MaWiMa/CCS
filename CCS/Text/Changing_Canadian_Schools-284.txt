Adapting the Syrkm to the Student
Through CICE, there is conm"derabh work done to modify and
adapt the course to each student And students are provided

support. Central to the role of the CICE fmulty members is
collaboration with other students and instructors so that

person whose main role would be to introduce her to other
students, initiate conversation and generally model a way of
