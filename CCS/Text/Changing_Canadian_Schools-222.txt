Collaborative Partnership
There are several important featurm of problem solving in a
collaborative environment. The ﬁrst is that team members
work together to solve problems in a partnership that empha-

Members of the teams make diﬂbmnt contributions based
on their expertise and varying responsibilities; they work

teachers brin@g problems to the team must provide informa-
