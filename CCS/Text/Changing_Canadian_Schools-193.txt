classroom setﬁng, teachers are now chall%d with the task
of restructuring their classroom pracﬁoe. As an alternative to
preparing and teaching a number of diﬁerent lmons within a
now class, teachers must develop a framework for planning
that allows for one main lesson with varying methods of
presentation, praoﬁse, and evaluation. Multi-level instruction
is one approach to the development of this framework.
WHAT IS MULTI-LEVEL INSTRUCTION?
Multi-level instruction (Schulz and Turnhull, 1984) is based
onthepremisethat one lesson vvillbe taughttothe whole clan.
It is an approach to planning that assumes the individualiza-
tion, ﬂexihility and inclusion of all students regardless of their
personal level of skills. It allows the teacher to plan for all
students within one lesson, thereby ding the necessity
for separate programs while allowing the teacher to weave
individual goals into the cm oontent and instructional
strategies.
In order to achieve this, teachers need to fully understand
the oonoept of multi-level teaching strategies. To develop a
unit or a lesson that is truly multi-level, the lemon must have
a deﬁnite aim for all students. It must also include a variety
of teacher techniques aimed at reaching students at all levels.
This means:
~ considering student learning styles when planning presen-
tation methods;
~ involving them in the lesson through questioning aimed at
ﬁﬁerent levels of thinking §e.g., Bloom’s Taxonomy, a
taxonomy of levels of oogni tive diﬁculty developed by
