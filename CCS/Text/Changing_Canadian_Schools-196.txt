Learning Styles ofStudent:
The teacher must remember that aclass is made up of students
who learn visually, auditorially, and kinaesthetically. Most
children tend to use one perceptual style more than the others.
Teachers need to plan instruction which addresm each stu-
dent’s dominant perceptual mode. Although eighty to eighty-
ﬁve per cent of students are visual learners, teachers tend to
teach most often in m auditory fashion. Teachers could meet
the nwds of visual learners by using the blackboard more and
incorporating ﬁlmstrips, ﬁlms, pictures, charts, and overhead
transparencies into their lesson presentation (Wood, 1984).
Teachers should obtain more information about percep-
tual learning modes, observable behaviours connected to each
mode, and teaching techniques for each mode (Wood, 1984;
Schulz and Turnbull, 1984).
To return to the example of teaching elements of a story or
novel, in using the multi-level approach to teach the idea of
setting in stories a variety of diﬁerent modes could be used.
'l‘he idea of setting could be intmduced by getting students to
ﬁscuss their own lives. This would allow each student to
express orally, perhaps to a partner, the setting of his or her
life. A student with limited verbal ability might be asked
speciﬁc questions by a student who has been coached in what
to ask. Another approach might be to discuss the setting of a
picture, a television show, or a story chosen by the student.
