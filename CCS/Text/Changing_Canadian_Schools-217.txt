SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH OUT VERBAL
SEJ.-S:
1. Assign students on a rotating basis to help others with
seatwork.
2. Students who have dimculty writing nota from the bmrd
can be required to copy only main parts of the notes. The
main ideas could be underlined so the student knows what
to copy. The student could also be given a photocopy of
another student's notes.
3. Non-readers could be provided with taped notes done by
the teacher or another student. The notes would only
include the essential points.
4. In oral spelhng tests perhaps the student would only be
responsible for beginning or ending sounds.
