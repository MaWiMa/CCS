An idea which was dismissed by all but a few educators just a
deca& ago is now becoming reality in an increasing number
of schools norm Canada. Students who have a disability are
being educated alonmide their nomdisabled peers.
This book is designed to ﬁll a gap in the momma available
to parents, educators and those people interested in educa-
ﬁonal poﬁcy and change. Canada is currently at a cmroad in
spedal educaﬁon practice. The traditional mwel of educating
students who have a dimbility in their own classrooms and
schools is giving way to systems which include all students in
the same classrooms. This approach; which is mandated by
law in the pi of New Brunswick, is replicated in school
districts, schools and individual olassrmms all across the
country.
The cumulative Canadian experience of inclusionary edu-
cation is now substantial. There is ample evidence that inte-
potion can and does work for all children regardless of their
disability or handicapping condition. However, much remains
to be done in order to move from present circumstances to the
point where inclusion in regular classes in the neighbourhood
school is taken for granted. This book is meant to assist those
who want to contribute to this effort.
