The author ﬁﬁnm “spwal-ordinary education‘ m ‘individu-
alized education" and notes that ‘teachers in the regular
classroom have been making mwiﬁcations and allowances for
years in order to accommodate individual needs.” He changes
the focus from learning problems to problems of instruction,
suggesting that, with suPP°l'l, teachers can modify and indi-
vidualize the curriculum for any student, esgﬁally if they
regard every student in the class as a potential co-teacher.

The author challenges ten often-heard objections to
mainstreaming. Attitudes dehimental to mainstreaming in»
clude a tendency to think in terms of a uniﬁed prescribed
curriculum and a focus on the disability rather than on the
person and the person’s abilities, "hence building a mac
against the child, rather than for the ohild’s inclusion In the
regular classroom.”
He further states that there is a need for regular classroom
teachers to aompt responsibility for all students and to accept
a wider range of individual diﬂbrences. The conollary to this is
the provision of appropriate support, information and re-
sources to teachers. He concludes that, “It is not that
mainstreaming hm been tried and found wanting; it has been
found diﬂicult and not tried.”
