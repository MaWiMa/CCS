Student to Student
Cuniculum and the Development of
Peer Relationships
by Julie Stone and Charlotte Campbell
In four years as consultants for the integration of students
with a mental handicap. we have had the opportunity to
omerve, analyze and compare many classrooms. We have
found that the inclusion of students with disabilities in
regular classes has been most eﬁective in schools where
aupporﬁve and interdependent relationships between stu-
dents have bmn successfully developed. In fact, many teach-
ers and parents are beginning to realize that one of the basic
reasons for including students with disabilities in schools and
claurooms is so they can be supported in building relan'on-
shim.
Wemtefs dictionary deﬁnes a relaﬁonship as the state or
condition that exists between people or pimps of people who
deal with one another. In schools, students spend mmt of the
day interacting with the curriculum and with each other.
Teachers have found that curriculum and regular clmsroom
activities operate as a springboard for the learning n%sary
for students to form relationships and became happy and
sucmssful in their adult lives.
