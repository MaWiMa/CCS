Canada is by deﬁnition a nation of diversity. The aboriginal
people of this vast country represent but a fraction of the
mosaic oi‘ ram culturm, relipbns, languages and lifwtylm
that is Tmcreasinﬂy evident in Canadian ciﬁes, towns md
villages. Outdated views of Canadians as descendants ofwhite
Eumpeans who speak either Engﬁsh or French have been

new reality has been mcompanisd (often painfully slowly!) by
a shill; in attitude and public penceptim.
Yet, while Canada evolvm into a country where diversity
of cultnml background is welmd and celebrated, other
disﬁnctions, particularly disability, still set some people
apart. These people continue to be met by insurmountable
mrriers, caused by other's attitudes, and by legislation, and
smietal policies and programs. They ultimately face
systematic discrimination and exclusion.
Of all disabilitiw, intellectual disability is the most
negatively perceived, leaving persons who have a mental
handicap to live with comprehensive discrimination and
emclusion. Lost in the Queue (Rioux, 1989) documents the
layers of this exclusion. 1% layers must be systematically
poled Mck in order for persons who have an intellmtual
disability to take their place as citizens and participants in the
full sense of communit-r life.
For persons who have a mental handicap and their
families, th barriers to the community are oﬁen extremely
destructive. They deprive people of self-actualisation,
wtmomic independence, intimacy in relationship, mental
and physical health, and the ability to chart the course of their
own lives.
