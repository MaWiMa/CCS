This latter from the mother of one of Mandy's clamata
shows just how much attitudw are chan@'ng:
As a relatively new resident of New Brunswick

cerned that my child, who had previously been in
French immersion, would not receive the extra attention

any way by integration; but she has bun greatly en-
riched, as has our whole family.
My daughters bestfriend is handicapped. They
are in the some class andare claw neighbours as well.
Morgan does not think of Mandy as handicapped. She
doesn't um Mandy any differen tlyﬁom any of hero-ther
ﬁ-tends, and cannot understand why some people make
a to-do about being Mandy’s ‘special friend’. To
Morgan, Mandy is specialjust bmause she is Mandy, a
loving, generous, funny little girl, her greatest friend.
My personal views on integration have greatly
changm. I have watched two little girls blossom to-
gether and I feel that wouldrft have happened without
integration. My entire family has been enriched by
getting to know a ‘handicapped child’; in fact I some-
times wonder who is truly handimppd. Mandy accepts
uswith all our limitationsand narrow-mindednessand
we accept Mandy for what she is, a child who is ﬁtnny,
