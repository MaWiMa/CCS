The Methods and Resource Teacher:
A Collaborative Consultant Model
by Gordon L. Porter
Since 1985, schools in New Brunswick school districts 28 and
29 have been using an inclusive appmach to educate students
with disabilities (Porter, 1986). This has required a number of
changes in policies and goals, organizational structures, in-
structional strategies, and support mechanisms. However,
the single most signiﬁcant change has been the redeﬁnition of
the school-based special education teacher.
For this new position, we adopted the term methods and
nesourm teacher (M&R teacher), from the Wellington County
Separate School Board in Guelph, Ontario (Forest, 1984). We
have invested considerable eﬂbrt in defming the role and in
training people for the position.
Methods and resource teachers are primarily responsible
for providing direct and effective support to classroom teach-
ers, with the goal of enabling all students to be meaningfully
included in learning activities in regular classrooms. M&R
teachers have a seconMry responsibility to “exceptional”
students who require individualized supports and services to
mrticipate in and beneﬁt from regular classroom instruction.
