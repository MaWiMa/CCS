PARENTS, PARTNERS
Many segregotionists within school systems cannot ampt our
principle that “the expert on a pupil is usually the parent”. In
fact,the wayapersoninthe edumtion system lmpondstothat
principle is oﬁen a good indication of that person's openness to
integraﬁm. Many good teachers and administrators welcome
the pmticipation of parents, and other support personnel, in
the overall educational enterprise. Other teachers and
administrators say they fear a loss of control over the
classroom. Or they seem to reject the idea that parents have
anything useful to otfer. These fears should be dealt with
sympathetically because the sumssful education of a pupil
with a mental handicap and, increasingly, of other pupils,
requires pa1"ent-teacher-administrator moperation.
We ﬁnd these fears are based on emotion rather than fact,
and there is plenty of experience to show that the fears are
generally unfounded. One of the most heart-warming aspects
of our eﬁorts over the years was seeing some teachers who
were afraid of “integration” become its strongest advocates
once they tried it.
We feel teachers and administrators have developed their
fears through incorrect information and attitudes taught by
faculties of education. In many cases, we see the teachers and
administrators as the victims of their education. We ﬁnd that
the faculties of education of all but a handful of our Canadians
universities desperately cling to outdated segregationist
ideology and conwpts based on out-of-date research. They
refuse to give teachers the training they need to enable them
to provide an appropriate, integrated education for all pupils.
We have come to the sad conclusion that most faculties of
education are incompetent in this major area. On the other
hand this means that we. as parents, should be prepared to
help and support willing teachers and administrators who
want to do the right thing but do not know how.
