with materials, particularly for readim, language arts and
math. Many teachers are spadﬁc about what they want help
with, while others are puzzled by a student's lack of success
and want the M&R teacher to help determine why.

Teachers are asking for help with students who just won't
do the work or who are acting out. Sometimes you don’t know
whether the student is having an mademic pnoblem because
of his behavioural diﬁculty or whether he's a behaviour
problem because he can't do the academic work:
The behaviour problems that come to me are where a
child is what you might call a lazy student. He doesn't
get his work done. He’s disorganized, hyperactive. Of
course, with integration we aim get emotimliy dis-
turbed or behaviour disordened kids. I work out a plan
with the teacher to decide what behaviour we’ne going to
target and how to deal with the behaviour.
Teachers also need moral support. One M&R teacher
reports that teachers just want to talk over their problems,
discum their ideas and get a second opinion on what they’re
doing. In most cases this is done informally, in the hallway or
in the staff room:
Teachers want to talk about the child who isn’t mould-
ing in with everyone else. He orshe isjust not doing well.
Sometimes the teacher just needs to ash ‘why isn't he
getting it?’ The teacher doesn’t understand the childis-
inmnsistencies and wants to talk it over.
