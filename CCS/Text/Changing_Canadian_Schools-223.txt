for interacﬁon. Teachers can share mowlwge and improve
their skills so similar problems can be dealt with more eﬂ'ec-
tively in the future. In most cam, it is neceg for teachers
to address seveml problem situations suemssfully before they
can handle problems independently. Training teachers to deal
with a single problem situation has been ineﬁective in teach-
