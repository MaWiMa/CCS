<p>Such integrated classrooms are shown to be more cost-effective than
resource room programs while they also enable students to achieve similar
academic results. This article gives evidence that providing special
education in a regular classroom setting is an attractive and achievable
option to the resource room withdrawal model.</p>

This study attempted to fill a gap in literature by investigating
students&#8217; perceptions and preferences about where and from whom they
receive special help. Children with mild handicaps in Grades 2, 4 and 5
were interviewed. The fact that students had different levels of knowledge
and experiences of different models makes the results complicated. The
authors conclude that most students prefer to obtain additional help
within the general education classroom from their classroom teacher or
from other non-specialists who are familiar with them and their classroom
curriculum.</p>

This survey compared satisfaction of parents of special education students
and parents of general education students whose children were all placed
in integrated elementary classrooms.
Both groups of parents were equally satisfied with the integrated
classroom model.</p>
