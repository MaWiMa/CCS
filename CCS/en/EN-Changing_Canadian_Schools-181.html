<p>This is an increasingly challenging role as children from different backgrounds
are bought together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, the teachar is forced to become a social coordinator, creating
a cooperative rather than a competitive environment by designing activities,
both academic and social, which support cooperative values. Since social
development is critical to successful functioning within a community, the
teacher&#8217;s role as coordinator is important to all students in the class.
Individual children are not lost in the cooperative structure; instead,
they are shown that they each have something to offer which is of equal
value to everyone else&#8217;s contribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a classroom which includes a child with a mental handicap, the teacher
includes this child in most activities and quietly encourages interaction
without drawing special attention to it. The other children soon assume
responsibility for any extra needs the child might have. It has been my
experience that they develop strong bonds with the child and may need only
to he cautioned against doing too much for him or her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monitoring the social development of all students provides teachers with
opportunities to assess the growth and maturing of individual students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Motivation</em></strong><br>
In a classroom where teachers need time to work closely with children with
special needs, the teachers need to be motivators. They must encourage
students to do their best, think problems through and develop self-discipline.
This develops independence and permits the teacher to have quality time
with an individual student without having to continually break away to quiet
or direct the other students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From my observation, smoothly running classrooms have teachers who are
motivators. They have regular dicussions with their students on the benefits
of sharing ideas, on problem solving techniques, and on responsibility.
These discussions are ongoing and are rarely reactive in nature.</p>
