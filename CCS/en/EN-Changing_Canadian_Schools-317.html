This integration model is based on a plan to bring students &#8220;home&#8221; from
special education programs and prevent others from ever being placed in
them. Based on the concept of individualized education for all, this
model enabled Vermont school districts to integrate students who present
some of the most intensive educational challenges within regular
classrooms. Participating teachers felt they had more say, were more
comfortable and bad better access to special education consultation than
expected.</p>
