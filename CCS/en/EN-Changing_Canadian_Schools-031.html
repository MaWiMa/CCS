<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many parts of North America, the expansion of special education has
resulted in the creation of parallel systems for regular and special
education. Many jurisdictions with the most mature and comprehensive
special education services have evolved to the point where the regular
and special education systems exists separately and relate toeach other
only in the most theoretical way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many who promote special education have developed a mentality of
compartmentalizing: rather than restructure a system that is inadequate,
&#8220;gaps in service&#8221; are filled with new special education programs
(Porter, 1990).</p>

<p>The goal, indeed the mission, of an effective school is to assure success
in learning for all students. The development of a parallel special
education systam has been harmful, not only because it has excluded
exceptional students and prevented their contact with non-disabled peers,
but also because of the effect it has bad on the regular education
program (Gartner and Lipsky, 1987; Reynolds, Wang and Walburg, 1987;
Stainback and Stainback, 1984; Will, 1986).
A School that passes over all the students with learning problems to a
separate special education system undermines its capacity to be a

<p>In 1982 &#8230;&#8203; I took the Student Services Department out of the
organizational chart and said were will be one department, and it will
be Instructional Services. Until than there were two heads of two
departments. I said if Student Services is part of Instuction then it
has to be part of that department, right at the board level too. We
didn&#8217;t wipe out the staff, but we [incorporated] Student Services [into]
Instructional Services&#8230;&#8203; People [often] want to keep the functions
separate. My contention is that organizationally we&#8217;ve got to have them
together. If there&#8217;s a sense of education being integral and being for
everybody, then those services have to be in the one department.</p>
