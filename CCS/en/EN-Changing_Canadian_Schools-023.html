<p>The case has received considerable national attention from both parents
and school officials (MacKay, 1987b; McCallum, 1987).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the impetus of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (1982),
a number of parents, parent groups, and educators throughout Canada have
been calling for more integrated and inclusive school programs for
students with disabilities.
In the province of New Brunswick, this led to political action, and,
as indicated above, subsequent legislative reform. Bill 85, which addresses
the equality and procedural issues for educational practise that flow from the Charter,
was unanimously passed by the New Brunswick legislature in 1986.
Section 45(2)1 of Bill 85 (1986) deals with placement considerations and

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A school board shall place exceptional pupils such that
they receive special education programs and services
in circumstances where exceptional pupils can participate
with pupils who are not exceptional pupils within regular classroom
settings to the extent that is considered practicable by the board having
due regard for the education needs of all pupils.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section provides clear direction that integrated school programs
are assumed to be appropriate for exceptional students in New Brunswick
schools. Alternatives are to be used only after every attempt has been
made to make an integrated program work. A school board may decide that
an integrated program is not practicable for a given student, for a given
period of time, for specific reasons; however, withdrawal is to occur
only for compelling reasons that are considered necessary to meet the
child&#8217;s needs and on the condition that a plan to return the child to
the regular class is made at the time of the withdrawal (Department of
Education, Province of New Brunswick, 1988a).</p>
