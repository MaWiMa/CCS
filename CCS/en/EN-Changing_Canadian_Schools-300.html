<p>This comprehensive textbook builds from a historical overview of education
integration and explores the rationale behind the movement toward a merger
of regular and special education.
Practial strategies show how all students&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whether labelled gifted,
non-disabled or disabled&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;can excel educationally and socially within
a regular classroom. Chapters are organized around key themes including
educational equality in practice, strategies to promote merging systems,
how to meet diverse student needs, and family and community support.</p>

Education Legislation: Implications for children, parents, and school
boards. The case of Bill 82 in Ontario</em>. Kitchener, Ont; CRESH.</strong><br>
In this policy analysis paper, education legislation in Ontario is
analyzed from several perspectives including its mandate and authority,
underlying values, and issues of implementation and outcomes. The paper
concludes that new policy options need to be considered which are
strongly grounded in the principles of the rights of the child,
integration of all children, and equality of access to educational
opportunity.</p>

work. <em>entourage</em>, 2(1), pp. 16-19.</strong><br>
Noting that &#8220;integated settings are on the increase all across the
country,&#8221; this article promotes individualized programs and the
discontinuation of a special, segregated education system. Three school
boards in Ontario are identified as implementors of fully integrated
systems and their success is largely attributed to committed administrators.
Problems with integration are characterized as ones of injustice which
belong to school boards and not to individual children.</p>
