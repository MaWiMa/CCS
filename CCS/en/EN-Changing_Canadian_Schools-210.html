<div class="paragraph">
<p>One suggestion for teaching these concepts was through the use of a movie
(e.g., The Outsiders by S.S. Hinton). This would be effective for all
students and particularly for two groups&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;visual learners, and children
with low reading levels. The concepts would be presented by a variety of
modes and then the novel could be the vehicle for project work based on
understanding the concepts.</p>

<h4 id="_method_of_student_performance">METHOD OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE:</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variety of assignments was developed to show an understanding of each
concept as it was covered. They ranged from the concrete to the abstract
in ideas and from the knowledge level to the evaluation level of
Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_method_of_evaluation">METHOD OF EVALUATION:</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual assignments were used as the major evaluation. Main concepts
were tested in a written form where possible. Adaptations were made for
students who had limited writing skills.</p>
