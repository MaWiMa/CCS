<p><strong><em>Peer Modelling</em></strong><br>
Another powerful technique which requires less preparation than peer tutoring
is peer modelling. In this situation, a student models for another classmate
how to perform an activity or skill. For example, one student might show
his classmate with a disability how to use a pencil sharpener, play a
cassette player, or find his way to the next class. Sometimes, the teacher
first needs to model the procedure for the nondisabled student. Often,
however, students spontaneously initiate and devise clever ways to encourage
a peer to take part in a myriad of activities.</p>

<p>A high school computer teacher described how a capable student voluntarily
spent time in class with Todd, a nonverbal and overly timid classmate.
Todd was often observed standing back from the other students with his
arms held up tight amt his chest, wringing his hands. The student worked
with Todd, teaching him how to use a simple computer program. As weeks passed
and opportunities for exchanges between Todd and his computer partner were
maximized, Todd&#8217;s classmates noticed him showing more interest in communicating
with and being around other students and teachers during the day. He still
stood apart from his peers often, but he now exhibited a more relaxed body
posture. The speech pathologists and teachers then reviewed their efforts
to encourage Todd in his attempts to speak, identifying additional strategies
to build his new-found confidence. Meanwhile, the computer student was
challenged by her involvement with Todd. On her own, she designed several
other computer programs for him, which were later entered in the district
Science Fair.</p>

<p>Teachers who realize the importance of peer friendships for students with
disabilities capitalize on the many opportunities for interaction that
naturally arise during the course of the school day.</p>
