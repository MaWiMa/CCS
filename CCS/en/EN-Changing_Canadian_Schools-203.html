This evaluation question can be done either orally or in a written

<p>When students are presented with a variety of assignments at varying
levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, the need for enrichment as well as
modification can be met. Most students, when given the choice of
assignments, Will select one that is appropriate. However, there are two
notes of caution:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Some students will choose the activities which are the easiest for them,
as they may not be highly motivated. This can be monitored by having
students maintain a chart showing their choice of assignments in various
units as they are covered. Restrictions can be placed on the number
of activities a student may do from a particular unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students may feel they are unable to do certain activities and,
because they never choose them, they never have the opportunity to
improve their skills in that area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A student&#8217;s choice of assignments should reflect a reasonable balance
between the need to succeed for motivational purposes and need to learn
new skills for the purpose of future success.</p>
