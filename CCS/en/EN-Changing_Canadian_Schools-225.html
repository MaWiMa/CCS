<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers usually work to solve problems on their own before seeking
consultative assistance. Typically, they try various classroom interventions,
confer informally with other teachers, or meet with parents. The teacher
may seek advice from a resource person because of his or her expertise
or because a supportive relationship has developed between them. Most
classroom problems are solved in this manner. If independent problem
solving doesn&#8217;t work, teachers may request assistance from a colleague
at the school or district office, or from the school problem-solving team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meetings with a team can be requested by the teacher or suggested by a
resource person, typically a methods and resource teacher, or by the
school principal. Meetings must be formally arranged because of the
work involved in coordinating five to seven people. Problem-solving team
meetings are effective for particularly frustrating situations, or when
it is deemed important to promote communication among a number of teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consultation does not end with the peer problem-solving meeting. It may
be decided, for example, that it is more efficient to have an methods and
resources teacher, guidance counsellor or district-level resource person
work with the referring teacher to thoroughly develop the specifics of a
particular intervention.</p>
