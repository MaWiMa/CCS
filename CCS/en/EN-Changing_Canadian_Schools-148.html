<p>Charts A2, A3, A4 and A5
detail the use of time in each area. Most of the time M&amp;R teachers are actively
engaged in collaborative and supportive activities with other staff members,
students and parents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is interesting to note that only about 13 per cent of the M&amp;R teachers&#8217;
time was devoted to pull-out instruction. Special education teachers have
substantially changed the way they use their time over the past five years.
As resource teachers and special class teachers, they were providing direct
instruction in a segregated classroom or to a small group on a pull-out basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was an emphasis on special education teachers replacing regular classroom
teachers as the instructors of special nude children. In their new capacity
as M&amp;R teachers, they spend a majority of their time consulting with and
helping teachers rather than replacing them.</p>
