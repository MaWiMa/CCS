<div class="paragraph">
<p>All people involved in the workshops stressed the importance of school
administrators rewarding effective teachers and sharing successes with school
board members, district office administrators, other educators, parents and
the community. For example, some schools made short videos showing how
exceptional students were integrated in their classes. Other schools, which
had volunteered to initiate integration projects,
allowed outside educators to visit and meet the teachers who were experienced
in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many principals requested that their teachers experienced in integration
be allowed to attend and make presentations at conferences and workshops.
One teacher said. &#8220;I realised my year was successful when my principal asked
me to share my experiences with other teachers in the school. His request was
a real compliment.&#8221;</p>

<h4 id="_conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the past few years, more and more educators have gained experience in
integrating exceptional students in regular classes. Many strategies have
been developed and have helped educators initiate integration and make the
process successful (Biklen, 1985; Sailor, Anderson, Halvorsen, Doering, Filler
and Goetz, 1989; Stainbeck and Stainback, 1989).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In New Brunswick, workshops have been held with educators experienced in
integration to identify and discuss what has helped them. Over the course
of these workshops, it was found that what was effective for one educator
may not have worked for another. Therefore, many strategies have been presented
here and more than one may be implemented to assist staff in a particular
school or school district.</p>
