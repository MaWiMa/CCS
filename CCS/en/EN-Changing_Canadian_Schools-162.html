<p>Students would automatically be placed in their age-appropriate class and,
through direct experience and training, the teachers would become less fearful
and would change their attitudes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the most part, teachers felt that actually having an exceptional student
integrated in their class had changed their attitudes and provided new learning
experiences. As one teacher described it, &#8220;Integration is in-service, ongoing
learning from the exceptional child&#8221; Another teacher stated, &#8220;Integration
is a catalyst for other things; now I look at working with other kids, like
gifted and many others who are out of the mainstream in my class.&#8221;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was agreement, however, that to ensure the full benefits of an integrated
program, the school administrator should be responsible for providing support
to the teacher. Initially this support might include release time for the
teacher to plan, consult and attend in-service training, and provisions for
helping the teacher directly in the classroom through a methods and resource
teacher, a teacher assistant, and student and parent volunteers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers with experience in integration wanted their colleagues to try an
integrated classroom and know that it was acceptable to make mistakes. Many
teachers felt that they learned through experience because their principals
had allowed them to try different ways of integrating students.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Planning the student&#8217;s transition from separate to integrated settings was
seen as an important strategy in the integration proccess. Planning should
begin before an exceptional student enters school or at the end of the previous
school year. Principal support and involvement help make transitional planning
run more smoothly and effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Release time should be arranged so teachers receiving an integrated student
have adequate time to observe, meet with the parents and current teachers,
and prepare for the student.</p>
