<p>Teachers who regularly use the principles of cooperative learning report
that it is a powerful tool in teaching children to respect and get along
with each other and in improving the social and academic climate of the
classroom. One teacher explains:</p>

<p>We worked in groups often. In these groups, no matter what, there was always
something that Dennis could do successfully, whether it was describing pictures,
repeating words or role-playing. It did not take long for the other students
to become adept at creating ways Dennis could actively participate in their
group. Their ideas and suggestions often far surpassed my own.</p>

<p>Research has shown that cooperative learning results in higher achievement
and greater retention of what is learned than do traditional competitive
or individual learning situations (Johnson, Maruyama, Johnson, Nelson and
Skon, 1981).
Other benefits, substantiated by research, include increased student
persistence in learning a task, more intrinsic motivation, higher levels
of self-esteem, acquisition of stronger collaborative skills, development
of positive peer relationships that extend beyond cooperative learning
activities, and the promotion of helping, sharing behaviours.</p>

throughout the day to share and explore ideas and bond together. Curriculum
is naturally a common subject of discussion:</p>

<p>September came and all my children arrived. Events went very smoothly.
I felt I was meeting the needs of all my children. I breathed a sigh of
relief; all was going well. However, around the end of October I became
vaguely dissatisfied with the learning of my special needs child. She was
in my class, but was she truly a part of the class? Finally, I modified
all her subjects to fit in with the rest of the class; whatever we did,
she did.</p>
