<p>What&#8217;s happened is that Luke&#8217;s been alienated from everyone around him&#8230;&#8203;
It starts first thing in the morning. Luke doesn&#8217;t go to school a couple
of miles down the road from us, the school where all the other kids in
the neighbourhood go. Oh no, he gets collected in a taxi and goes miles
off in the other direction.</p>

<p>Parents have increasingly united and worked together to turn their
visions from dreems into reality. &#8220;We have become a united voice, a
resource to other parents and [the] community, and strength to one another.
It is because we have stood together that we have seen many significant
and exciting changes in our schools and our community,&#8221; says Alene
Steinbach, a parent

<p>However, while advocacy by both associations and parent groups is
important, it is individual parents who  must carry on the real struggle.
Each parent must decide whether or not to engage in the struggle for
integration. The number of people making that choice is growing as
parents tell their succees stories:</p>

<p>For years I watched Mandy stand alone on the front lawn as all of the neighbourhood children rushed by
her. I remember thinking, &#8220;Please, just one person stop and talk toher, just one of you ask her to play too&#8230;&#8203; !&#8221;
[O]ne of the most important benefits of being included [in a regular class is] that Mandy now has friends.
[Her] original group of [three] friends has now more than quadrupled in number. They are her classmates, the people who
speak up and support her, her advocates at school and in the playgrounds at home&#8230;&#8203; It is her classmates who come to our
home to call on her to come out to play, her fiiends who invite her to parties and dances, and the kids who are anxious
to see her at Brownies, the Mall, gymnastics, figure skating, the ball diamonds, and the hockey rinks. These are the kids
who can&#8217;t wait to introduce me to their parents as &#8220;Mandy&#8217;s mom. Mandy, she&#8217;s in our class&#8221;</p>
