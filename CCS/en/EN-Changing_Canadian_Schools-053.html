<p>Furthermore, the relationships formed between the student who has a disability and his or her peers can last a lifetime and the
benefits will touch both lives. In the past, most non-disabled students never had opportunities to meet an individual with a
mental handicap. Therefore, many adults are unsure about how to react to individuals with a disability they meet as neighbours,
clients, patients, customers, colleagues or co-participants in leisure activities. When the generation of students now in
integated classes grows up, our communities should be transformed. The children who are helping to solve the challenges of
accommodation in the classroom will be the adults who will make aooommodation possible in the workplace and who will expect
their communities to include their former classmates. Non-disabled adults often turn to relationships formed during their school
years to assist in finding a job or a place to live or simply for friendship. And so students who have a mental handicap and who
have experienced integrated education will also have a network of relationships, and a community of peers who understand how to
accommodate their needs.</p>

<p>Already there are many stories about individuals who have a disability who have grown up as part of their communities and are
benefitting from the friendships they formed. One story involves a young doctor who was able to respond to the needs of a patient
at the scene of an emergency because he had grown up on the same street as her and knew how to respond to her. Other doctors and
nurses had reacted nervously to the woman (Schaefer, 1982). Another story involves a person who has been labelled mentally
handicapped and who is the business partner of two former classmates, one a doctor and the other an accountant.</p>
