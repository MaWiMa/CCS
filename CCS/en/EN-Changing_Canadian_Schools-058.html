<p>Children one screened out of the education system by being divided into two categoris: those who can be educated and those who
cannot be educated. Those who are labelled uneducable are than no longer considered the responsibility of the neighbourhood
school. The classifications&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;educable and uneducable&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are accepted because they are said to be based on objective and value-free
criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is these classifications are founded on a knowledge base which presumes that the criteria determining whether a
person is &#8220;educable&#8221; are inherent in the potential student. With this presumption, other conditions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as the way the
education system is structured or the way it operates â€” are not taken into consideration. There is no investigation into how
structural or operational conditions affect a child&#8217;s ability to benefit from angular education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people have been convinced that scientific criteria ensure objectivity and, therefore, it is acceptable to create
legislation based on such criteria. The political and social consequences of deciding that someone is uneducable are seldom
taken into account or questioned.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second myth is that education is equitable. Not only is it presumed that all children have access to the public
educationsystem but it is presumed that they all receive a similar or equal education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Universal access to education is thought to include the notion of an equivalent and impartial quality of learning. This means it
doesn&#8217;t matter who the child is or where the child goes to school, what the child learns will be up to an accepted standard.</p>
