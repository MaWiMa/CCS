<p>Several M&amp;R teachers mentioned using other faculty members to provide reinforcement
to teachers. One described a situation where the principal served in this
role:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have so make sure the teachers are given positive reinforcement for
what they&#8217;re doing. They&#8217;re just feeling their way and they need positive
reinforcement to keep going. I&#8217;ve gone to the principal and said, &#8220;This
Grade 5 teacher is doing a really fine job; why don&#8217;t you tell her that

even if you&#8217;re very, very experienced.</p>

or more informal approaches was mentioned by several teachers.
In one particular small school, the M&amp;R teacher suggested that all seven
staff members act as a team. Now they frequently discuss problems and help
each other resolve them. The methods and resource teacher&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;who was new
