<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet another myth fostered by special education theory is that children
with a mental handicap will be socialized better in the regular class,
but that their academic work will suffer.
We were once told that this was the trade-off and that we would have to
make a choice between socialization and education for our son. People who
say things like that seem to believe that children with a mental handicap
have little understanding and no feeling. They are wrong. Parents will
understand what we mean when we say our son is slow, not stupid. He and
his friends understood quite well that they were in segregated classes
bcause they had been rejected by the regular school system because they
were considered inferior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When our son had a chance to go into a regular class he reacted well
because he clearly felt he now belonged. He worked harder and progressed
more quickly than he had in the segregated classes. Better socializafion
had a positive, not a negative, effect on his academic progress. A pupil
who is surrounded by other pupils behaving normally is likely to behave
normally and to work as others work. A pupil in a segregated class is
likely to be distracted by behaviours around him or her and imitate them,
rather than working.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most segregated classes provide less individual attention than regular
classes, making them inferior learning environments. This was true of the
segregated classes our son attended, despite the efforts of excellent
teachers in those segregated classes. Some of those teachers who went on
to teach in regular classes told us that, in a segregated class, each
exceptional pupil gets only five to ten minutes of individual attention
on most days. A properly organized teacher with a regular class containing
an exceptional pupil can provide more than ten minutes of individual
attention to the exceptional pupil without short-changing the non-exceptional
pupils. So not only is the learning environment better in a regular class,
but experience suggests that there are more opportunities for individual
attention.</p>
