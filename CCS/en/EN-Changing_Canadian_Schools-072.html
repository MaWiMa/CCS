<p>The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal which held that the lower court judge had misapplied the test for granting an
injunction. While the Court Appeal overturned the lower court ruling in <strong>relation to the relief sought</strong>, it ordered that the
injunction was to remain in place until the end of the school year. Prior to the beginning of the next school term,the matter
was settled in favour of the child. A settlement agreement which required that Nathalie be integrated was approved by court order.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada has not had the opportunity to rule on the question of whether there is a constitutional right for
all children to attend school in their neighhourhood in a regular class. The court has, however, stressed the importance of the
State providing an education to its citizens. The constitution has continually made education the exclusive jurisdiction of the
provinces. It can be argued that, where the provincial/territorial government has undertaken through legislation to provide an
education, that education must be provided without discrimination to meet the constitutional standard imposed on provinces and
territories by s.15.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legislation typically enables the education minister to delegate responsibility for the day-to-day education and administration
to school board officials. In addition to holding school hoards accountable for the practice of segregating children with mental
disabilities, some parents have made simultaneous claims against ministers of education who have the ultimate statutory duty.</p>

<p>The recent settlement of the <strong>Charter</strong> challenge in Ontario, <strong>Hysert v. Carleton Board of Education et al.</strong>, demonstrates the
importance of asserting a shared responsibility with the provincial or territorial government. The case was settled just prior
to trial when the attorney general advised counsel for the school board that the government intended to amend
its statement of defence.</p>
