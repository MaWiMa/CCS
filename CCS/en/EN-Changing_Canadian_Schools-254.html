<p>The two students had spent time together in school during noon hours and
they shared a few classes together. Although one of them had difficulty
speaking and often engaged in echolalia (the involuntary repetition of a
word or sentence just spoken by another person), the friends had obviously
found other ways to communicate their feelings, interests and thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some teachers had seen the relationship as one-sided and felt that the
non-disabled student was being charitable. When it was discovered that the
non-disabled student had hitchhiked fifty kilometres in the middle of a
Christmas cold snap, wearing only a light jacket with a broken zipper, to
see his friend in the hospital, the adults took the friendship more
seriously.</p>

<h4 id="_conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who use the various strategies outlined above to encourage peer
relationships know that full integration will only occur when students
interact comfortably with one another both in school and in the community.
Since most of the hours of a student&#8217;s day are spent in school, teachers
can use curriculum and school activities as a vehicle to encourage and
maintain friendship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proximity and reciprocity are important in setting the stage for interactions.
In order for people to form relationships, they must be in the same place
for a reasonable length of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And if a student&#8217;s gestures of friendship are repeatedly ignored, he or she
may stop trying to interact. The onus is on the teacher to encourage students
with disabilities to respond and to inspire non-handicapped students to
persevere and search for responses which might otherwise be overlooked.
Eye and head movements, position changes, smiles and gestures are sometimes
the only way a person has of responding to his or her peers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human beings present particular personality traits and
specific interests or skills which make them attractive to one another.</p>
