<p><strong>Jenkinson, J.C. (1987). School and disability: Research and practice in
integration. <em>Australian and Education Review</em>, 26.</strong><br>
A broad review of literature on integration issues, this study attempts
to identify various approaches and the factors that lead to success. It
contains a number of descriptive studies of integration programs as well
as a review of American and Australian research and practice. The book
contains an extensive critique of research aimed at solving the
integration-segregation debate. Problems in the application of traditional
and alternative research methodologies are also discussed. An extensive
bibliography of research and policy literature is included.</p>
