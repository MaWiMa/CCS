<p>The methods and resource teacher sees that the student&#8217;s schedule is well
planned and realistic and that the student&#8217;s progress is monitored carefully.</p>

<p>In addition to assisting students in course selection, M&amp;R teachers work
closely with the guidance counsellor and administrative personnel. They
also coordinate community work programs; they find the sites and provide
training, supervision and monitoring of community placement.</p>

<p>I find I have to get an overall picture of the student. It takes a lot of
time and you have to look at that student in many different areas to get
a true picture of what the problem could be, diagnose where the problem is.
Sometimes you think you know and then you get some more information which
changes the whole outlook.</p>

<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewed identified several practical day to day tactics
to support the teacher. Some take over and teach the class, which permits
the teacher to do planning and curriculum development. A second M&amp;R teacher
can work with the classroom teacher for an extended period of time to plan
and prepare needed materials. &#8220;I know one teacher was having trouble completing
a couple of things for an exceptional child. I said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go in your classroom
for twenty minutes while you go and jot down your ideas. I&#8217;ll put your ideas
in the right order and work on them for you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>M&amp;R teachers report that they prefer to modify and adapt existing curriculum
to come up with usable materials. Classroom teachers and students also seem
to prefer curriculum materials related to the regular instructional program.
As a result, much of the work of the M&amp;R teacher is to assist the classroom
teacher in adapting the content and vocabulary of materials so they can
be used by exeptional students:</p>
