<p>An idea which was dismissed by all but a few educators just a decade ago
is now becoming reality in an increasing number of schools across Canada.
Students who have a disability are being educated alongside their
non-disabled peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book is designed to fill a gap in the resources available to parents,
educators and those people interested in educational policy and change.
Canada is currently at a crossroad in special education practice.
The traditional model of educating students who have a disability in
their own classrooms and schools is giving way to systems which include
all students in the same classrooms. This approach, which is mandated by
law in the province of New Brunswick, is replicated in school districts,
schools and individual classrooms all across the country.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cumulative Canadian experience of inclusionary education is now
substantial. There is ample evidence that integration can and does work
for all children regardless of their disability or handicapping condition.
However, much remains to be done in order to move from present
circumstances to the point where inclusion in regular classes
in the neighbourhood school is taken for granted.
This book is meant to assist those who want to contribute to this effort.</p>
