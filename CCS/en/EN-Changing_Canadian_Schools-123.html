<p>&#8220;Being a methods and resource teacher is different. We need traing on how
to be a collaborative consultent rather than the expert.&#8221;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewd were in ongoing training every other week, which
they felt was important for developing a sense of continuity and follow-up,
for ideas on new materials and new methods, and &#8220;to provide occasions where
teachers can sound off to one another.&#8221; The ongoing sessions also help
keep the M&amp;R teachers&#8217; morale up and their commitment to carrying out their
job high. M&amp;R teachers often feel alone in their perspective and uncertain
about matters. Meeting with their peers to talk over the successes as well
as the frustrations of the job, and to develop a sense of team work among
themselves is beneficial:</p>

<p>The training sessions every other week oregreot. We&#8217;ve been airing a few
of our problems and deciding on how to go from there. We decide what we&#8217;d
like to see done and build from session to session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I really enjoy talking with the other methods and resource teachers. I think
that&#8217;s the most valuable thing &#8230;&#8203; to be able to talk things over and say,
&#8220;I do it this way&#8221;, or !&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried this and it works&#8221;. There are so
many more ideas [available].</p>

<p>M&amp;R teachers at the high school level suggest that their needs are somewhat
unique because of the departmental organization of their schools. They feel
they need to meet with other M&amp;R teachers in high schools to share perspectives,
problems and solutions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the district training program now in its fifth year, districts 28
and 29 teachers feel the need for making adjustments. Each year there are
five or six people new to the position and the training they require is
quite different from training for more experienced teachers.</p>
