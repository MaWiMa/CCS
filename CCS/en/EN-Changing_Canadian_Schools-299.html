Association on Mental Deficiency (AAMD): Education Update</em>, 11, p. 2</strong><br>
Three issues in the social integration of students with handicaps are
highlighted. First, the author argues that full integration is the only
acceptable route for the education system.
Second, he points out the difficulties in defining and promoting
the development of friendships as distinct from helper-helped relationships
between children without and with handicaps.
Third, he raises the issue of how students&#8217; relationships at school carry
over to their relationships outside of school.</p>

The authors maintain that operating a &#8220;dual system of education&#8221; is
unfair, inefficient, and expensive. They argue for the incorporation of
all the resources and services (funding, curriculum, personnel) from both
regular and special education into a single unified educational system.</p>
