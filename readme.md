# Changing Canadian Schools
#### Transcript and Translation  
***  
Since 5th ofMarch 2013 I try to translate -Changing Canadian Schools- into German.  
Changing Canadian Schools is a book from the early 90s and I read it because of [professional interest] (inclusion/Inklusion.pdf) on inclusion.
The first time I download the book from [www.eric.ed.gov] 
(http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED341224&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED341224 "You wil not be able to download the book any more, but why don't you try"). I guess, you can only buy it used, if you want a hardcover.  
I split the [copy] (copies-from-original/BestCopy_Changing_Canadian_Schools_Perspectives_on_Disability_and_Inclusion.pdf) into each page to go through translation side by side.
