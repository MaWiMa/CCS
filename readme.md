# Changing Canadian Schools
#### Transscript and Translation  
***  
Since 5th of March 2013 I try to translate -Changing Canadian Schools- into German.  
Changing Canadian Schools is a book from the early 90s and I read it the first time in 2011 because of [professional interest] (inclusion/Inklusion.pdf) on inclusion.
Until 2011 you could download the book from [www.eric.ed.gov] 
(http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED341224&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED341224 "You will not be able to download the book any more, but why don't you try"). I guess now you can only buy it used, if you want a hardcover or use this [copy] (copies-from-original/BestCopy_Changing_Canadian_Schools_Perspectives_on_Disability_and_Inclusion.pdf).   
I split the copy into each page to go through translation side by side.
If you want to work with me (or maybe later us), you should know how to use [git](http://git-scm.com/) and write [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is all quiet simple, *if I can do this everybody can do it!* All work can be done within a simple editor.  
I run the wiki with [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/blob/master/README.md) at home, it is really lovely and simple do work with that software.
