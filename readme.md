# Changing Canadian Schools

Since 5th ofMarch 2013 I try to translate -Changing Canadian Schools- into German.

Changing Canadian Schools is a book from the early 90s and I read it because of [professional interest] (inclusion/Inklusion.pdf) on inclusion.
The first time I download the book from 
http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED341224&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED341224
(you will not be able to do so, try if you like),
You can only buy it used, if you want a hardcover.
I split the copy (copies-from-original/BestCopy_Changing_Canadian_Schools_Perspectives_on_Disability_and_Inclusion.pdf)
into each page to go through translation side by side.
