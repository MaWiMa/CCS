== background and questions

=== Original Book
*Changing Canadian Schools* is a book from 1991 and I read it the first time in 2011 because of
link:/CCS/inclusion/Inklusion.pdf[professional interest] on inclusion.
I was searching for experienced people and changing canadian schools seems to be sampled experience on inclusion from the view
of students, their parents and teachers. I want to look at former times and than look what happened till that time.
For short -- I felt the urge for learning more about the progress of inclusion.

You can download the book from this site:
http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED341224 under this link http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED341224.pdf[ED341224.pdf].
If the link is dead now, take link:/CCS/copies-from-original/BestCopy_Changing_Canadian_Schools_Perspectives_on_Disability_and_Inclusion.pdf[my copy],
trust me, it is the same copy. I guess the book can only be bought used now.
I got my own used hardcover on April the 17th in 2013.

To go through translation by the pageful, I split the copy into each page. I use only the front and back-cover of
my own book, the rest is from the source above.
White pages are left out, the pages are numbered like the copies are counted, not like the real bookpages.
Look at one page and you will recognize what is meant.


=== Transcript and Translation, why?

Now and in my mind inclusion describes the ratified right to education for all. People are taught within the same general types of schools
in one study group. The diversity of individuals builds the basis, to the development of the skills of all.

Since 5th of March 2013 I try to transcript and translate *Changing Canadian Schools* into german.
I like to be a part of a socialgroup, so I start and hope a few or more will join. +

In former times I was an expert in special education, the german way, and in 2011 I changed my attitudes.
My attitude changed as I wrote a short comparsion on special education in Canada and Germany.
Since 1994 I should know about inclusion, because of the Salamanca Conference; I did not like most other germans did not too.
I recognized, special education, the way we do in germany -- till now -- is not the right way to help pupils be part of real life.

I believe inclusion is a good way to teach and learn,  in germany it seems to be down before it is really started (not because it has
a horrible name, like a desease. I often hear teachers and parents talk about inclusive children or inclusive classes;
using this term this way is marginalization again). 
Maybe this happens because it is done top-down. It seems as if things get done better, when learners and their parents
want a change and renew structures in education.

My goal is to look with more than two eyes on inclusion, by going back a lot of years in a country where changes had happened.
I would like to translate with many, not only because my translation is surely faulty and if your
interested in working together with people on this,
we maybe also can discuss what education should do.

Changing Canadian Schools was written in french and english. We have a special discussion in germany --
just like an open competition in comparsion of empty statements -- we compare the words integration and inclusion, for what?
In french inclusion is integration, as far as I know native french speakers do not use the word inclusion.
In germany inclusion was first translated into integration, belatedly it was redefined as inclusion.
This is the truth (Salamanca Declaration, german translation 2006 and 2010).
I think it does not matter how you call what you do, but it does matter what you do. 

=== static website

First I tried to do the work in a wiki with https://github.com/gollum/gollum/blob/master/README.md[gollum] at home,
it is really lovely and simple to work with that software.
Now, after a time I did nothing on this stuff, I decided not to do it through wiki.
I thought it has do be done through wiki, to be fast. After I realized that even the transcript gets done real slow,
I changed to static webpages.
Everything should be done from now on with asciidoc(tor), with a static website for online-readers, and later pdfs or epubs for
those who like ebooks and print out papers.
Look at the https://github.com/MaWiMa/CCS/commits/master[commit-history] to look how this grows.
