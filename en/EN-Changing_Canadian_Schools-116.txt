Most teachers feel much more at ease if we can take the regular program
and deal with that so that these kids can still be a part of the class.
They find it easier to cope that way.

I always mob sure the teacher has input. The teacher looks through the
objectives with me and then I take away what we have agreed on. I always
type it up,then give it to them and ask them to look it over. If I'm modifying
the program, I do the modification that we've talked about and I always get
them to OK it before I go ahead. They're the ones who tell me whether I'm
doing alright.

==== WHAT IS NEEDED TO DO THE JOB?

===== Professional Background
Most of the people interviewed for this study had been regular class teachers
with more than ten years of experience each before becoming M&R teachers.
These teachers were mainly recruited into the M&R position while on staff
at the school in which they now work. They were selected for their suitability
for the job. Only a few had pre-service training in special education, although
a number of the others took special education courses after becoming M&R
teachers.

A handful of the teachers interviewed had been special class teachers,
specifically of students labelled "`trainable mentally handicapped`". They
evolved into the M&R role as the integration of these students proceeded
in the school system.

Most of the teachers felt that regular class teachers experience was essential,
and that M&R teachers should be able to identify with the experience of
the regular teacher:

I think experience as a regular class teacher is necessary. It would be
a mistake to bring somebody totally new into the job. The good thing about
having somebody who was a classroom teacher, especially from the same school
or district, is that teachers see you as another teacher. I think that's
good. You're more aware of what some of the problems are.
