=== The Methods and Resource Teacher: A Collaborative Consultant Model

_by Gordon L. Porter_

Since 1985, schools in New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29 have been
using an inclusive approach to educate students with disabilities (Porter, 1986).
This has required a number of changes in policies and goals, organizational
structures, instructional strategies, and support mechanisms. However, the
single most significant change has been the redefinition of the school-based
special education teacher.

For this new position, we adopted the term methods and nesource teacher
(M&R teacher), from the Wellington County Separate School Board in Guelph,
Ontario (Forest, 1984). We have invested considerable effort in definig
the role and in training people for the position.

Methods and resource teachers are primarily responsible for providing direct
and effective support to classroom teachers, with the goal of enabling _all_
students to be meaningfully included in learning activities in regular classrooms.
M&R teachers have a secondary responsibility to "`exceptional`" students
who require individualized supports and services to participate in and benefit
from regular classroom instruction.
