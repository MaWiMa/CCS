<p>Because a child&#8217;s special needs may be beyonds teacher&#8217;s experience, we
are forced to throw out some of our traditional methods and find innovative
approaches. What we discover is that all our students benefit from this
change in practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One year I was assigned to teach french to a class which included a blind
student. Although it was a language course, the lessons included a lot of
visual stimuli. In order for the blind student to participate and be involved,
the language had to come alive, which we achieved by physically acting out
situations. The students loved not having to sit at their desks doing board
work. The results were so much better that I used the same approach in another
French class I taught which did not include anyone with special needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the years I have had students with a wide range of needs. They have
opened my eyes to countless new ways of doing things. And because of this
creative freedom, I have realized that the child&#8217;s learning process is every
bit as important as what he or she learns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Common Objectives</em></strong><br>
For many children with special needs, the regular academic objectives are
not appropriate. Programs need to be modified, with much more emphasis
placed on helping students to develop into functional, contributing members
of their community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers should have a vision of the desired results and avoid confining
themselves to a list of objectives for a particular grade level. Everything
a teacher plans for the student should fit into the vision the teacher and
the parents, and, in many cases, the student have for his or her future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Collaboration</em></strong><br>
Because teachers often view having a student with special needs as a big
responsibility, it is wise to embrace the collaborative spirit. Collaboration
with other school staff members is an extremely intelligent approach with
far ranging benefits.</p>
