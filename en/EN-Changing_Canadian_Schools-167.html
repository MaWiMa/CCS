<p>In another school, the principal first scheduled the integrated teachers
for physical education, art and music classes, and at the times they wanted.
One teacher in this school chose to have her art, music and physical education
back-to-back so she could have at least one long, uninterrupted preparation
period per week. Another teacher in this school requested her special classes
at the end of the day so she could continue her preparation right after school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In another school the principal allowed his staff to brainstorm for ideas
on giving extra preparation time to one teacher who had an exceptional student
integrated in her class. The teachers decided that their colleague would
be released from lunch and recess duty. The principal also taught this
teacher&#8217;s class one period every two weeks in order to provide time for
her to collaborate with the methods and resource teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The educators described another popular strategy. The administrators and
methods and resource teachers supply taught for a period while classroom
teachers used the time to plan or meet with their own methods and resource
teacher.</p>

<h5 id="_meet_with_teachers">Meet with Teachers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teachers, both regular class, and methods and resource, agreed that
they felt well supported by principals who were available to meet with them
either on a regular basis or at their request. The teachers mainly needed
their principals to listen to them in an open-minded way, be a sounding
board for innovative ideas, support them and reward them.</p>

<h5 id="_share_experiences_and_problem_solve">Share Experiences and Problem Solve</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout the process of integration, sessions for sharing both successful
and unsuccessful experiences and for problem solving have helped educators
to make changes and experience the benefits of integration. Sharing successful
experiences may help to allay the fears of teachers and school administrators
who are new to integration.</p>
