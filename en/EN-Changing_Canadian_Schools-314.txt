Emphasizing actual teaching techniques, this book is of interest to
teachers, administrators, and parents. Section I includes seven chapters
about specific disabilities and integration. Section II focuses on
innovative techniques and Section III outlines changes needed in the
education system.

The forms of integration described and advocated for cannot be achieved
by special education alone. "`It will be necessary for '`regular`'
teachers to join in the process of creating new and more inclusive
programs that encompass literally all students.`"
