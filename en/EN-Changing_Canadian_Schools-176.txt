//fore, is to respond professionally to the challenge, fear, and excitement of teaching all children. <-- page 175
I will examine some approaches to that response. I am confident that as
teachers read they will frequently say, "`I am doing that in my classroom
already`", or at the very least,"`I can do that`". And administrators will
feel that they have teachers on staff who fulfil the requirements capability.
This is because the similarities between teaching a regular class and an
integrated class far outnumber the differences.

I will examine the role of the teacher from four perspectives. The first
deals with the teacher as a person and as a professional. The second addresses
the teacher operating in many capacities in the classroom. The third focuses
on the specific relationship between the teacher and the exceptional student
in his or her class. Finally, we have a look at the highly collaborative
nature of the classroom teacher-support system liaison.

==== THE TEACHER: PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY

*_Strategies in Preparation_*
Teaching an integrated class requires a personal as well as a professional
commitment. It is not enough for the school board, the superintendent and
the school administration to support the philosophy of integration. The
actual success or failure of integration hinges on the classroom teacher's
beliefs and practices. In fact, the strongest indicator that integration
will be successful is the degree to which the classroom teacher believes
in the idea. The teacher must believe that the school is the most natural
setting for students to grow and learn from each other and from educated
adults.

One of the most common remarks teachers make when facing integration i
that they are not ready for it. They say there is too much they do not
know and they feel ill-prepared.
These are real concerns and should be acknowledged.
