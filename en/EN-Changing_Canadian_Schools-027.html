<p>By the mid 1980s, the Integration Action Group was providing sophisticated
support to individual families struggling to achieve integration. Since
1987, the Centre for Integrated Education (now called the Centre for
Integrated Education and Community) has been another source of training,
consultation, and resource development for both parents and professionals.
Such initiatives are unique to Canada and have helped give parents the
courage and determination to seek integrated educational fittings for
their children. Parents have insisted with considerable success that the
traditional special education system change. The increasing demand from
parents has been evident in every province and territory and the concerns
that have created the demand have been consistent. Parents&#8217; demand for
integrated education stems from a vision for their children&#8217;s future which
they only see realized in a regular class with non-disabled peers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a meeting for parents of special needs children, we were asked,
&#8220;What is your dream for your child?&#8221; I never [thought] I had a dream
for my son Daniel who has special needs&#8230;&#8203; After thinking about it,
[however, I realized] I do have a dream for Daniel&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a very simple dream.
I dream of Daniel taking an apple to his teacher, of packing his lunch for
school, of seeing him in a school play, and of him bringing home his report
card. These are very ordinary things for most parents, but to the family
of a [mentally handicapped] child, these are dreams that bring unexplained
joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I have another very special dream for Daniel that is coming true right
now. While at play group Daniels friend Evan sits with him &#8230;&#8203; I hope when
my son is in high school, his friends will say, Daniel doesn&#8217;t need an
attendant all day&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;we&#8217;ll help him with his lunch&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;we&#8217;ll make sure he
gets to classes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;we&#8217;ll help him to get on and off the bus. We&#8217;ll take
him to the school dances and basketball games, simply because he is our
friend and we care about him.</p>
