pp. 174-186.</strong><br>
&#8220;Success with integration in schools depends on and also fuels
integration in society at large&#8221;. This chapter suggests five principles
upon which to base the social transformation which must accompany
successful integration.</p>

(Ed). <em>The Politics of Special Educational Needs.</em> London: Falmer Press,
pp. 97-122.</strong><br>
The author suggests that the goals of integration are to redefine
&#8220;normality&#8221; to include diversity and to support people to identify their
own aspirations and opportunities. He looks critically at the different
ways in which the concept of integration has been interpreted in
literature. The concept of integration should prompt teachers and others
to challenge the social relations and curricula of schools and link these
to the ways in which inequalities are maintained.</p>

possible for everyone. <em>entourage</em>, 5(2&amp;3), pp. 15-I7, 20.</strong><br>
In 1971, integrated schooling was mandated by Italian law for all students
aged six to fourteen years. This article describes the continuing struggle
with issues of labelling, time
individualization and appropriate supports, after almost twenty years of
experience with an integrated system.</p>
