// play with her friends in and out of the school. <-- page 99
==== THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY
Mandy now has friends; I think this is one of the greatest benefits of
inclusion. For years I watched Mandy stand alone on the front lawn as all
the neighbourhood children rushed by on their way to school or games. I
remembered thinking, "`Please just one person stop and talk to her; just
one of you ask her to play too.`"

My eyes fill with tears when I remember the first time our doorbell rang
and there stood three little girls asking, "`Can Mandy come out and play?`"
The look of pure joy on Mandy's face was a dream come true.

The original group of friends soon more than quadrupled in number. Now
Mandy's classmates are the children who speak up and support her; they
are her advocates at school and in the playgrounds at home. These children
speak proudly of the joys and triumphs they have shared with Mandy, not
only at school but in the oommunity. Her classmates call on her to come
out to play; they are the friends who invite her to parties and dances
and who are anxious to see her at Brownies, gmnastics, figure skating and
baseball. These are the children who can't wait to introduce me to their
parents as "`Mandy's Mom; Mandy -- sheâ€™s in our class`".

Integration is more than just education in school. It is a part of
everything we do. Mandy's integration does not start and stop in school;
she is an active member of her community.
Besides belonging to the figure skating club and attending the summer
playground programs and gymnastics, Mandy was a Brownie for three years.
The Brownie leader admitted that when she first learned that Mandy had
enrolled in her pack she was scared. But she said that, once she got to
know Mandy, she realized, "`There isn't anything she can't do. She's not
a problem. We just love her and the kids all look for her on Wednesday
nights.`" Recently, the leader was asked if she had any children with
special needs in her Brownie pack.
