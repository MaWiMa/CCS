<p><em>De facto</em> segregation appealed natural and proper because of the numerous
examples of legally sanctioned state-approved discrimination.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Education for children with mental handicap has been, and continues to
be, a disturbing combination of both forms of segregation. In some
provinces, school acts made specific provisions for children with mental
handicaps to he educated in &#8220;special&#8221; schools and classrooms (<em>de jure</em>).
In other places the practice and policies of school boards has been to
treat children with disabilities as &#8220;special&#8221; and in need of a separate
educational program outside the regular classroom (<em>de facto</em>). However,
the <em>Charter</em> and human rights legislation have provided parents with
powerful new weapons in the fight they wage daily on behalf of their
children to gain access to an equal education.</p>

<h5 id="_the_first_legal_challenges">The First Legal Challenges</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first case to challenge segregated education, Mr. and Mrs. Balm of
British Columbia, on behalf of their son Arron, claimed that their school
board had failed to fulfil their educational duty of care when it exercised
its statutory power to decide to place the child in a segregated,
self-contained, special school on the basis that the child had a mental
handicap. The <em>Bales v. Central Okangan Board of School Trustees</em> case
was framed in negligence because it took place before the equality rights
provision of <em>Charter</em> came into force.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trial judge held that the <em>School Act</em> did impose a duty on the school
board to provide sufficient school accommodation and tuition, free of
charge, to all children of school age. However, while the judge was
sympathetic to the evidence that integration was becoming the norm, he
followed the judidal tradition of legally sanctioning segegation. It is
notable that this
decision came prior to the existence of any constitutional protections
in Canada.</p>
