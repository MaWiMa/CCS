==== STAGES OF PROBLEM-SOLVING MEETINGS

*Stage 1:* The facilitator states the reason for the meeting and explains
the process to be followed and the problem to be dealt with. He or she
can also outline the problem-solving process if needed. Additional
responsibilities of the team facilitator include:

. helping the referring teacher state clearly and concisely what the
problem is by finding out specifically what the teacher wants to happen
that is not happening now. The more precise the problem is stated, the
better;

. briefing the other team members on the problem. This is not always
necessary, but often helps the prrocess;

. asking one team member to act as recorder. This member can still be an
active participant in the group;

. helping each team member stay on topic, and give clear, appropriate,
practical suggestions;

. ensuring that the meeting lasts no longer than thirty minutes.

Teachers who have participated in problem-solving meetings state that
facilitators should be positive, business-like, task-oriented, and able
to clarify issues and summarize well.

*Stage 2:* The referring teacher makes a brief oral statement about the
problematic situation.

*Stage 3:* Team members ask questions of the referring teacher to clear
up any uncertainties they may have as to exactly what the problem is or
what the circumstances are.
