<h4 id="_conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My goal has been to show the simplicity of integration. In fact, so much
of what has been described here is already accomplished well by teachers
every day in clasrooms everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any teacher who believes it is his or her professional responsibility to
accept and teach all children will find a way to make integration work. Any
teacher who believes it is his or her personal responsibility to uphold
the value of all children will do so.</p>
