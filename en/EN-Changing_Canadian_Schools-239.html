<div class="paragraph">
<p>In four years as consultants for the integration of students with a mental
handicap, we have had the opportunity to observe, analyze and compare
many classrooms. We have found that the inclusion of students with
disabilities in regular classes has been most effective in schools where
supportive and interdependent relationships between students have been
successfully developed. In fact, many teachers and parents are beginning
to realize that one of the basic reasons for including students with
disabilities in schools and classrooms is so they can be supported in
building relationships.</p>

<p>Weebster&#8217;s dictionary defines a relationship as the state or condition
that exists between people or groups of people who deal with one another.
In schools, students spend most of the day interacting with the curriculum
and with each other. Teachers have found that curriculum and regular
classroom activities operate as a springboard for the learning necessary
for students to form relationships and became happy and successful in
their adult lives.</p>
