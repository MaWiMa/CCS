==== Changing Attitudes in Schools Towards Integration

Integration is for everyone. For n while I wondered whether it was really
going to work for a few, but now I realize it is for everyone. It might not
be using the same methods or it might not be for the same time limits, but
you have to be open to that. You have to look at the student as an individual.
All students have a right schooling and having people be positive -- mind
you there a lots of problems. With anything new there are going to be problems
-- but we're conquering them one at a time. It's great to see it working.
I had doubts when I first started.

While this teacher has a very positive and optimistic view towards the
integration of students with disabilities, many teachers in districts 28
and 29 don't share her enthusiasm. M&R teachers report that most teachers
have accepted that integration is going to take place and that it is probably
in the child's best interest. Many are apprehensive about what they are
expected to do with the student with special needs. Some teachers are concerned
that through classroom integration, the student will miss the benefits of
more individualized instruction. One M&R teacher with experience teaching
a segregated class suggested that teachers "`don't understand that what
you do in a one-to-one situation is basically what would take place in the
regular classroom.`" Some teachers continue to nurture the idea that the
movement towards integration might end:

There are still people saying it's a cycle ... that we're going to do away
with all this integration. I don't think it's a cycle. I think that things
are evolving. It may be true that next year we'll do things a little
differently, but we will be improving on what we're doing now.
We're never really going to segregate those children and go back to the
system we had before. I think parents are too aware of the situation to let
it go back.
