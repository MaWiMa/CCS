<p>In Chapter 1, we have identified three factors connected to achieving
school integration:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a legal and legislative base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocacy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a vision clearly articulated and effectively
advanced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;creativ educational practice that captures the vision
and turns it into reality in classrooms and schools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each chapter in <em>Changing Canadian Schools</em> adresses one or more of these
factors. Taken together they offer a broad perspective on the issue in
question. The book&#8217;s three sections&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Philosophical, Legal and Historical
Overview; Parent and Self-Advocacy; and Innovations and Practical
Applications&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;parallel the evolution of an inclusionary approach to
schooling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The first section</strong> describes the ideals and attitudes that led to a
desire for inclusive education. Various contributors explain the social
theory and legal action that arose as people began to work towards their
ideals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The philosophical underpinnings of education integration are part of the
overall vision of rights for people who have a mental handicap.
Chapter 2 explains the vision as articulated by the Canadian Association
for Community Living. It explains that education which includes all
students is a critical foundation for building communities in which all
individuals can participate, regardless of disability.
Peter Park, a founding member of People First of Canada, an advocacy
organization of individuals who have been labelled mentally handicapped,
sums up the situation:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have to thank my father and mother for not putting me in a segregated
school back in the &#8217;50s when they were just starting. They said. &#8220;No,
you have to go to a regular school&#8221;, and I have benefitted from it. I
had regular friends, got into regular trouble, and all the things a person
does when they are growing up.
When you are in a segregated setting nobody else wants to talk to you,
nobody wants to have anything to do with you except the people that you
have daily contact with. So you don&#8217;t make friends there. You don&#8217;t know
how to conduct yourself appropriately.</p>
