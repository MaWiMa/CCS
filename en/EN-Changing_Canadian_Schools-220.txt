=== Problem Solving Teams: A Thirty-Minute Peer-Helping Model

_by Gordon L. Porter, Mary Wilson, Brian Kelly and Jeff den Otter_

==== PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES FOR TEACHERS

Schools which successfully include all students must employ a range of
strategies and techniques so teachers can gain the support they need.
The teacher-helping-teacher problem solving strategy has proven to be an
effective method of creating open, productive collaborative consultation
among educators. We have developed and refined the strategy over several
years. It has been particularly useful as we have implemented integrated
or inclusionary programs for all students.

The fundamental principle of the process is that _teachers can help other
teachers_. Problem solving proceeds through an orderly sequence of steps
from the initial designation of the problem to the development and
implementation of a plan to resolve it, to evaluation of progress, to
monitoring. The process is dynamic, evolving, flexible, and cyclical
in nature.
