"`See if you can get it out.`" In Donnie's full view, the peer placed one
of the treats inside one of the blocks. Donnie chose the correct block
immediately, struggled to open it, and seized his prize. The game continued
for several minutes. As Donnie struggled to open the block each time, the
peer-carried on with his own work.

The peer then took the two blocks and, holding them out of Donnie's sight
under the desk, placed a Cheezie in one of the blocks and placed the two
blocks back on the table. Donnie tried to open the blocks as the peer
carried on with his work Donnie was successful and his peer gave him a smile
and a thumbs-up signal. Donnie smiled broadly as he enjoyed his prize.

*_Cross-Age Tutoring_* +
Some teachers successfully employ cross-age tutors -- older students who
assist younger students with their work. Older students may read to their
young peers, listen to them read, or assist them with story writing or
math. Although this technique requires more time to set up because teachers
are needed to assist tutors in preparing activities and presentstion
strategies, teachers remark that the result is well worth the effort.
Tutoring gives older students the opportunity to analyze and think through
a particular skill or activity at a deeper level than they would ordinarily.
Teachers remark that students are often better than teachers at explaining
an idea or procedure because young people relate so well to one another.

Cross-age tutoring also provides excellent opportunities for students who
are experiencing learning difficulties themselves to support and help other
schoolmates. The tutoring provides older students with opportunities to
practise certain lessons and to be on the giving side of a relationship
during school. Teachers using this technique remark on how it benefits the
tutors`' self-esteem and how this feeling carries over into their general
self-confidence.
