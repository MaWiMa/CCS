==== STEP TWO: METHODS OF TEACHER PRESENTATION
Once the underlying concepts of the lesson are established, it is clear
that the lesson cannot be presented in one way to all students, if all
students are to be sucessful. Therefore, the idea or concept to be barned
must be presented in such a way that all students are able to gain
varying degrees of knowledge based on their level of understanding.

*_Learning Styles of Students_*
The teacher must remember that a class is made up of students who learn
visually, auditorially, and kinaesthetically. Most children tend to use
one perceptual style more than the others. Teachers need to plan
instruction which addresses each student's dominant perceptual mode.
Although eighty to eightyfive per cent of students are visual learners,
teachers tend to teach most often in an auditory fashion. Teachers could
meet the needs of visual learners by using the blackboard more and
incorporating filmstrips, films, pictures, charts, and overhead transparencies
into their lesson presentation (Wood, 1984).

Teachers should obtain more information about perceptual learning modes,
observable behaviours connected to each mode, and teaching techniques for
each mode (Wood, 1984; Schulz and Turnbull, 1984).

To return to the example of teaching elements of a story or novel, in
using the multi-level approach to teach the idea of setting in stories a
variety of different modes could be used. The idea of setting could be
introduced by getting students to discuss their own lives. This would
allow each student to express orally, perhaps to a partner, the setting
of his or her life. A student with limited verbal ability might be asked
specific questions by a student who has been coached in what to ask.
Another approach might be to discuss the setting of a picture, a television
show, or a story chosen by the student.
