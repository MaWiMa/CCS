<p>The M&amp;R teacher needs to have confidence that the principal expects
program decisions will be supportive of students and that teachers will act
to meet students&#8217; needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers reported that they often use informal means to update the principal.
They may drop into the principal&#8217;s office from time to time or have discussions
whenever they meet in the school. Others schedule formal meetings with the
principal, and in some cases the guidance counsellor, on a weakly basis.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Very httle pull-out instruction is occurring in the schools of New Brunswick
districts 28 and 29, and M&amp;R teachers feel that very little out-of-class
instruction is required. Most of them do very little of it, only twenty
to thirty minutes a day, three or four days a week, according to the time-use
survey
<a href="/CCS/en/EN-Changing_Canadian_Schools-149.html">(see page 149)</a>
.
Only one teacher had a student out of regular class for longer&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;six-and-a-half
hours out of a twenty-five-hour instructional week. Instead, small group
instruction is often carried out in the regular classroom with the M&amp;R teacher
or teacher&#8217;s aide. Considerable use of peer-tutoring has lessened the need
for pull-out or cut-of-class instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual or small group instruction is most frequently needed for reading
and other areas of language arts, or when a student is being easily distracted.
Teachers described instances where the special needs student was distracting
other students from their work and was taken from the class for a short
period of time to get the behaviour under control before returning to the
classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Community-based instruction programs also involve time out of class. These
include community access activities like going to the library, the bank,
the post office, or going out to a restaurant with an adult. In most cases,
a teacher&#8217;s aide accompanies the student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Districts 28 and 29 policy discourages but does not prohibit pull-out instruction,
requiring that the pull-out occur after other alternatives have been tried.</p>
