Moderately and Severely Handicapped Learners: Strategies that work</em>.
Springfield, ILL: Charles C. Thomas.</strong><br>
This practical guide does not ask, &#8220;Does integration work?&#8221; or &#8220;Who
can be integrated?&#8221; Instead it addresses the question, &#8220;How can we make
integration efforts successful?&#8221; It places educational integration
within the larger context of overall community inclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sections cover strategies for administration, service delivery, and
planning and implmentation of individualized plans. Included are how-to
ideas and checklists of ways to involve students with severe handicaps
in regular programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authors conclude that &#8220;Integrated school experiences can be provided
for all severely handicapped students across a variety of school settings.&#8221;</p>
