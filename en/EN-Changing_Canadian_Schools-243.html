<p>I had not been doing this because my special needs child had little or no
speech. When we all began doing the same subjects, she began to respond
to the other children, making more attempts to communicate verbally with
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I still wasn&#8217;t satisfied. Things were going well, but my special needs
child was still not interacting enough with other children. Also, some of
my other students were beginning to show very serious problems. They needed
more of my time.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then one day in Woodstock I was introduced to cooperative learning. The
workshop was exiting. I felt that I had a partial solution to my problems
in the classroom. This strategy made sense. There are a lot of things you
need to learn about cooperative learning, but basically it is students
helping students strive toward an academic goal. Not only academic skills
but social skills are taught and evaluated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took awhile to set up the cooperative lessons, but when they began they
were exciting. The children were working together in groups, responsible
for their own learning as well as others&#8217; learning. It was amazing to see
children on their knees in their chairs, working through problems or
discussing different topics. Now it was really hard work to pick out my
special needs child.
She was part of the class, working along with the other children, sometimes
with an aide, sometimes with me, but mostly with the children. She was well
on her way to becoming independent as well as interdependent.</p>

<p>In addition to using lessons to promote the development of relationships,
teachers have been creative in devising ways to weave support from other
professionals into the fabric of everyday classroom activities and student
routines (Giangreco, York and Rainforth, 1989).</p>
