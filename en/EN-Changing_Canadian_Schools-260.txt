Ifa poop of peers does not include a child with a disability
in their relationships, adults usually take responsibility for
replacing the peer group. But adults are inappropriate role
models. What is work for adults is normal activity for children.
The regular clmm is an important place for healthy,
inclusive peer relationshim to develop. Children who are
disabled need support in Mveloping nelationshim, and non-
ﬁsabled children need supmrt in accepting their peers who
have disabilities. Teachers can play a key role in ensuring that
these relationships develop.
Inmlving the Children
There is a reewakening interest in using students as a positive
inﬂuence on the behaviour or learning of their mere. Adults
are usually surprised to discover that children are capable of
performing many functions that were once thought to be the
exclusive province ofadul ts. Giving youth more responsibility
in our schools is an untapped resource that offers great
potential for innovation. Research on instructional strategies
such as moperative learning and peer tutoring has demon-
strated the advantages of mahng students more responsible
for mutual learning.
Another means of facilitating peer interdependence and
responsibility is to have students, as a goup, intentionally
make a commitment to help a peer with special needs. This
recently developed form of structured peer involvement has
come to be known as a peer support group or “circle of friends”
(Perske and Perske, 1988).
