Building ongoing friendships that extend outside school and into the
neighbourhood has been a challenge for teachers and families. Part of the
challenge is that friendship cannot be defined, analyzed, predicted or
assigned like school work.

Friendship is like sex: we always suspect there is some secret technique
we don't know about.

Friendship can only be encouraged by setting up opportunities for matches
to form.

Difficult as it is to define friendship, it is easy to describe why
friendships are important and how they enrich our lives.
They help us stretch beyond our families; they help children rehearse
adult roles; they are a haven from stress and they demystify strange and
inappropriate behaviour (Perske, 1988).
As one youngster commented,

Your friends will like you even when you act like a jerk.

Friendships expand our world and our perspectives; they are attractive
and generate their own energy; friendships are freely chosen and voluntary;
they are mutual and reciprocal, coming and going with intensity varying
over time. Friendships have their ups and downs, joys and pains, laughter
and tears (Pogrobin, 1987).

Some teachers become discouraged and doubtful when searching for ways to
help a student with disabilities make friends. They feel that "`real`"
friendships cannot exist between disabled and non-disabled people and that
efforts to encourage friendships are staged and phoney.

In actual fact, adults can overlook or misinterpret relationships that
exist between disabled and non-disabled students.
We must he careful not to impose a stereotypical image of how friendships
should look and therefore devalue budding friendships that have non-traditional
features. There have been some remarkable friendships between disabled
and non-disabled students.

Teachers in one school were truly amazed to hear about a student's efforts
to visit his friend with a disability who was in
the hospital struggling with a life-threatening condition.
