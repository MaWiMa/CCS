<p>Since regular teachers increasingly provide educational
programs to children with more diverse needs, this article points up
possible training and certification implications based on the trend
toward education integration in Canada.</p>

students in regular classrooms: Teacher attitudes and teacher in-service
needs. <em>Canadian Journal for Exceptional Children</em>, 2(1), pp. 14-17.</strong><br>
Based on a survey of teachers in two southern Ontario school boards, as
well as on the conclusions of other related research studies, this author
calls for an increase in the variety and intensity of in-service education
options for teachers. Quality in-service education can facilitate teacher
confidence, sense of support, and knowledge regarding the classroom
integration of exceptional students.</p>

American teacher preparation programs continue to be linked to specific
handicaps and based on assumptions of student deficit rather than teacher
ability. This chapter describes one vision for the future in which
&#8220;special&#8221; teacher preparation programs will disappear and one system
will prepare all teachers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author sees this structural change in teacher education as a difficult
but inevitable and exciting development which has already begun and which
will parallel the growth of student integration in the schools.</p>
