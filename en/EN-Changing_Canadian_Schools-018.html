<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is somewhat ironic that the very organizations that first legitimized
the education of children who have mental handicaps are now the ones
fighting to dismantle the systems that are the product of their success.
Yet, when the Canadian Association for Community Living (CACL) established
a task force to identify issues facing the advocacy movement for people
with mental handicaps, integrated education was rated a top priority
(CACL, 1987). The goal of the Association is to promote the participation
of people with mental handicaps in their communities by focusing on their
citizenship (the power to exercise their rights), their inclusion (as full
members of their communities), and their self-determination (the power to
make their own decisions).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rioux (1988) documents how specialized and separate services result from
a paradigm that labels individuals with intellectual handicaps as socially
inferior. Therefore, the kind of care and treatment available to them,
as well as laws, policies, and programs, have been developed solely on
the basis of this label. Criteria for generic programs systematically keep
out people with mental handicaps and there is a rationalization of the need
for parallel and separate systems.</p>
