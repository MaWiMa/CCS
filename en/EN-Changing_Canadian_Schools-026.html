<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although many of the segregated schools that existed across
Canada in the early 1980s had been started by local chapters
of the Canadian Association for Community Living (the national
advocacy association for persons with mental handicaps)
segregated schools and segregated classes no longer satisfy
the aspirations of many families. Parent advocacy for integrated
schooling has increased substantially in the years following
adoption of the <em>Charter</em>, particularly by parents of children
labelled mentally handicapped. CACL has advocated and promoted
the right of every student to attend a regular class in a
neighbourhood school. This policy has been formally supported
by all off CACL&#8217;s provincial and territorial affiliates

<p>While integation was not a matter of priority to most local
or provincial associations in the early 1980s, at the national
level, The Roeher Institute, sponsored by CACL, began to support
parents as they struggled to articulate their concerns about
their children&#8217;s education. At the community, provincial and
national levels, parents found solidarity and strength by banding
together. As parent demand grew, the (Roeher) Institute and
CACL identified and promoted positive examples of integration
and facilitated training for educators to work in integrated settings.
These courses led to the establishment of university affiliated
programs that are currently providing teachers and school
administrators with the attitudes and skills they need to meet
increasing parent demand for integration. Since the early 1980s,
the (Roeher) Institute and CACL have actively promoted integration
through conferences and seminars, publications, video productions,
and financial and consulting support for selected litigation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>CACL actively supported the development of an autonomous parent
organization, the Integration Action Group, which now has a
substantial membership in southern Ontario and a number of chapters
in other provinces.</p>
