<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> The referring teacher gave a brief description of Amanda and
specified that he wanted her to improve her reading skills and to work
independently, and also to gain self-confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Team members now had a chance to ask any questions for clarification.
One member wanted to know whether there was support from the home, which
there was.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> During the brainstorming session all suggestions were directed
to the facilitator. The suggestions were:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Have Amanda read to a younger student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeatd reading: have Amanda read the same story several times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have her keep a journal to express her feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet with her parents to develop a plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make up a checklist of things that she has to do to be more organized.
She can check off each item as she completes it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have her copy class rules for a display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the homeroom teacher discuss with her how important it is to ask
for help. Include peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit homework time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a private signal with her that will indicate that she needs
help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use computer software to help with reading and writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teach Amanda the five-finger test for choosing her own reading material.
Take a book and open it to any page and as you read put a finger down for
any word you don&#8217;t know.
Five fingers for one page means the book is too difficult; no fingers
means it is too easy; somewhere in between is best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have Amanda present oral book reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that homework is related to reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have Amanda read to a parent for fifteen minutes every night. Have them
read alternate paragraphs to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that Amanda is not singled out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
