The fact that I've only been teaching a few years is, I think, in some ways
a help. I can say to the more experienced teachers, "`Well, how would you
handle this problem?`" It's almost an internship where we're constantly
exchanging ideas. There's a lot of feedback. I've prevented the teachers

and I don't think it's working.`" So we pitch in and try something else.

I think you have to be a little more careful with the teacher who's "`bucking`".
I know that the little things count. If I wanted to meet with a teacher,

far as to arrange the meeting in the smoking staff room  if that's what
they wanted and I'd make coffee ahead of time and have everything ready
so it was pleasant meeting.

I've learned never to lose my temper. I will hold it back.
I may spout off afterwards [to another M&R teacher], but I will not let
the [classroom] teacher see that I am upset or frustrated.
