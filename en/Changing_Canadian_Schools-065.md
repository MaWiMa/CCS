# Changing Canadian Schools

This is because of a persisting
utilitarian philosophy which assumm the greatest good for the
peatest number cfpwple is achieved when educam-s target
students with the maximum potential for contributing to the
maintenance ofthe mchl and economic order.

ciency. Fundamental values and the conuihuﬁoms ﬁom pwple
with diﬁrent intellectual abiliw are ct‘ no value within that
framework. Therefore edumﬁon, lib other institutions in late
twentieth century society, has become a politiwl activity.
THE NED FOR RESTRUCTURING
Educators, students, administrators are mught up in this
wedi@eut. It is still impmsibls to make square blocks ﬁt
into round holes. Education integraﬁon is now little more than
a mucosa of putting students with disabilitim in time
where the structure ensurm failure for the mﬂority of them,
creating the ﬁhmma that both participaﬁng and not partici-
pating are disadvantageous. There is an entire body of litera-
tum conmrned with theories of Mucation and special educa-
tion; all these worlts begin with pmmw that are counter-
productive to achieving real equality in the education system.
Toe educaﬁon system has, ultimately, helped “educate”
society into a form ofblindness about how people with mental
handicam enrich and enhance society. Much more meativity
is needed if we hope to achieve real leaming and real under-
standing within the antiquated structure of the education
system. The system must do more than simply open its doors;
it must be restructured to value the contributions from per-
sons with disabilities, from women, and ﬁom people with
diﬂbrent cultural experiences. Governments will have to oom-
mit themselves to that process through the provision ofﬁmds.
And educators will have to be open minded and innwative in
teaching and addressing students. The oontribuﬁon that
people with a mental handicap make to the edumtion system will
have tohemrtofthe reconstruction oftheeducation system.
