In a classroom which includm a child with a mental
handicap, the teamer includes this child in most mtivitim and
qm'etly encourages interaction without drawing special atten-
tion toit. The otmr children soon assume responsibility fm' any
extra needs the child might have. It has lawn my experience
that they develop strong bonds with the child and may need
only to he motioned against doing too much for him or her.
Monitoring the social development of all students provides
teachers with opportunities to same the growth and matur-
ing of individual students.
Motivation
In a clam where teachers need time to work clmely with
children with special needs, the teachers need to be motiva-
tors. They must encourage students to do their best, think
problems through and develop self-discipline. This develops
indemndence and permits the teacher to have quality ﬁme
with an individual student without having to continually
break away to quiet or direct the other students.
From my observation, monthly running classrooms have
temhers who are motivators. They have regular dimussicms
with their students on the beneﬁts of sharing ideas, on
problem solving techniques, and on responsibility. These
dismssions are ongoing and are ranely reactive in nature.
