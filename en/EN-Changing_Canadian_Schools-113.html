<p>Teachers want to talk about the child who isn&#8217;t moulding in with everyone
else. He or she is just not doing well. Sometimes the teacher just needs
to ask &#8220;why isn&#8217;t he getting it?&#8221; The teacher doesn&#8217;t understand the child&#8217;s
inconsistencies and wants to talk it over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[The teachers] need support. They want to know that what they&#8217;re doing is
right. Even teachers who have been at it a while were saying, at the first
of the year, &#8220;We don&#8217;t hnow how to handle [integration of students with
disabilities]. I&#8217;ve never had to deal with this before.&#8221; When I simply
out lined what the objective was for the student in the class they took
right off. It&#8217;s amazing. They&#8217;re doing it right and I just provide a lot
of positive reinforcement. For example, I tell them, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need my
help, you know what you&#8217;re doing a you&#8217;re doing a good job&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes teachers really need a practical suggestion, some little thing
that clicks for them. Sometimes it is related to the student and sometimes
to the teacher. Maybe it&#8217;s an adjustment of teaching style, and the suggestions
you make don&#8217;t fit their style. You have to know what their style of teaching
is to really reach them.</p>

<p>Meetings! A lot of meetings! That&#8217;s part of the planning, of course. You
meet with parents, you meet with teachers, teacher&#8217;s aides and others.
You&#8217;d like to have more time to yourself, but you&#8217;re usually in meetings,
I find.</p>

<p>This typifies the role of a teacher acting as a consultant in a school.
The major actities identified by methods and resource teachers usually
involve partnership with other teachers. This includes extensive discussions
with the teacher about the student&#8217;s difficulty and needs, and content and
structure of the individual program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work of methods and resource teachers is highly varied, with requirements
changing all the time, and people relying on their assistance daily. For
these reasons, M&amp;R teachers reported, they have to be both flexible and
responsive so they can be available when the teacher needs support, which
means they must plan their time very carefully.</p>
