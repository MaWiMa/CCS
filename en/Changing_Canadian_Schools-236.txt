We have found teacher collaboration in the form of peer
problem-solving teams helpful as we vmrk to integrate stu-
dents with disabilities into regular classrooms in our schools.
The process providm a way to help teachers develop strategies

lum or instructional assumptions. Peer problem-solving
teams have helped us promote the goals of inclusionary
schooling. A commitment to collaboration is needed to create
schools where mutual support in solving problems prevails.
