<p>When you watch a student with special needs with friends around, going on
her own to the cafeteria, you feel good.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the biggest thing that we&#8217;ve done, other than integretion, is to
make teachers aware of the fact that all children are not learning at grade
level, and that they have to teach them at their level and have them meet
with success at that level. A lot ofchildren are having their needs met,
[who] before would have just been pushed along or ignored. Teachers are
addressing the whole situation differently.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we&#8217;re really talking about is just good teaching practice anyway.
We&#8217;re not neally saying anything new to teachers. It&#8217;s just making them
re-think and look at what they&#8217;ve been doing all along. I think there&#8217;s a
tendency now for teachers to see every child as an individual rather than
have a mass of thirty kids. I think in a few years teachers won&#8217;t be as
reluctant to have multi-level instruction in the classroom as now. Everybody
doesn&#8217;t have to be learning the same material at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="_conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is clear that the recruitment and selection of appropriate candidates
is essential for the M&amp;R teacher concept to work. Special education training
would be a benefit, but regular classroom teaching experience is an essential
prerequisite. Teachers with successful teaching experience bring a background
and measure of credibility to the position that can&#8217;t be taught. Ongoing
training is necessary and teachers who have the potential should be recruited
and encouraged to switch to the M&amp;R teacher role.</p>
