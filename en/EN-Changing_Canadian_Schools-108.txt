Donna hired a tutor to give me extra support for a while. It was great.
I was learning. I made a commitment to stay with it.

I Iove going to Sacred Heart. My teacher Barb and I have a routine. I make
a sentence and I say it in to a tape recorder. Barb then writes the sentence
and we work on each new word. I make my own dictionary with my new words.

I'm doing so well that I now read in my church on Sundays. When my sister
Patty got married I asked her if I could read at her wedding. At first she
said no. A friend at church asked me to read on a special occasion. Another
friend told my sister that I did a good job. After that she asked me to
read at her wedding. My relatives said I did a good job.

I do not have many problems at work. I can read my duties. I can go to P.D.
days and I can participate in what's going on because I can read some of
the notes and I can write notes. I can now read books. I learn more now.
I can be more independent because I can read signs in the community. I can
help children to read I feel good about myself because I can do it. I love
learning to read. It inccreases my vocabulary and this helps me to express
my feelings and my thoughts better. I am President of People First in Hamilton.
I can now write my own agenda for the meetings and I can read letters from
other groups that come to me. I read these letters to my group. There are
words I don't know yet. I get stuck sometimes but people help me. I keep
practising.
