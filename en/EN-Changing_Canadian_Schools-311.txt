Winner, M. (1984). Mainstreaming the handicapped
child: Attitudes of teachers and non-teachers. _Canadian Journal for
Exceptional Children_, 1(1), pp. 23-26.* +
An attitude survey reveals that regular classroom teachers question their
own competence to teach a child with special needs. They also fear
increased time demands and worry about dilution of the academic content
of their programs. This article calls for a continued focus on staff
development on integration issues, since the regular classroom teacher
"`is the indispensable professional who will carry the primary
responsibility for integrating the exceptional child.`"

==== 2.3 Practical Strategies
*Baker, C. and G. Baker. (1982) Suggestions on how to more effectively
mainstream special education students. _Special Education in Canada_,
57(3). pp. 16-18.* +
Ideas to assist teachers in facilitating integration address placement
in the classroom, preparation of the regular teacher, preparation of all
the students, and follow-up.

*Berres, Michael S. and Peter Knoblock (Eds.). (1986). _Program Models
for Mainstreaming: Integrating students with moderate to revere
disabilities_. Rockville, MD: Aspen Publishers.*
This hook begins with the assumption that integrating children with
moderate to severe disabilities depends more upon the attitudes and
problem-solving skills of the educators than on the skills of the 
students. The first section focuses on the values and philosophy of
integration and discusses models for change within the school system.
The second section describes integration efforts in school systems across
the U.S.. These include accounts of innovative practices, successes,
failures and the particular challenges presented by different
disabilities.
