The Canadian Association for Community Living estimates that there are at
least an equal number of people living in nursing homes, chronic care
hospitals and private institutions. In addition, a 1991 study conducted
by CACL reports that there are over 114,000 children and youths in segregated
education programs, the vast majority of whom have a mental handicap.
Furthermore, tens of thousands of working-age adults who have a mental
handicap are excluded from competitive employment. Instead, they attend
sheltered workshops or job-readiness programs or are excluded from any
activity day after day (CACL, 1991).

==== THE STRUGGLE FOR INCLUSION
Just as other minority groups in Canada have struggled for inclusion in
the mainstream of society, so people who have a mental handicap, their
families and their friends have engaged in a long campaign for inclusion.

The first organized activities began simultaneously around the world
immediately after the Second World War. Learning from the rehabilitation
services which assisted disabled veterans, parents of sons and daughters
who had a mental handicap came together to develop rehabilitation services
in the community. These services were their alternative to placing their
children in large, custodial institutions. The parent groups evolved into
associations which took the lead in creating opportunities for their sons
and daughters with mental handicaps.  

Because their children were denied entry to public schools, the first
priority of the associations was usually to begin a class, and then
eventually a school in which to teach them. The teachers were often
volunteers, or, if paid, were not professional educators because the
teaching profession had not yet accepted that children who had been labelled
"`retarded`" could learn.
