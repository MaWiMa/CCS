==== HISTORY

Programs for teachers of students with special needs have come under a
variety of labels: pre-referral intervention; teacher support teams; and
teacher assistant teams (Canelli and Lange, 1990; West, 1990; Chalfant,
Pysh and Moultrie, 1979). Our present use of problem-solving teams in
New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29 originated with the teacher
assistant team (TAT) concept developed by James Chalfant and his associates
in the United States. This model was created to address the increasing
referral of students to special education services and to stop the flow
of referrals for formal assessment. The goal was to handle more situations
at the school level, reduce the number of inappropriate referrals, and
use special education personnel more effectively.

In 1979 we brought Chalfant and Pysh to our district to train teachers
and administrators from each school in the use of their model. Subsequently,
schools set up teams by either recruiting volunteers, holding elections
or having the principal choose team members. Despite the fact that results
were mixed and the model eventually fell into disuse with teams disbanding
in most schools, we had many positive experiences with the TAT model.
Those experiences became a useful resource as teachers worked hard to meet
the challenge of integrating students. We looked anew at the elements of
the TAT model that were most compelling for our circumstances and our
present day problem-solving teams become an outgrowth of our experience
with the teacher assistant team model.

Our revised model is a mix of old and new ideas. The purpose of referral
is now to give teachers needed support to keep all students in regular
classes. The facilitator is most often a school-based methods and resource
teacher or a guidance counsellor. The make-up of the teams is flexible
and open to whatever considerations seem relevant. The process followed
during the thirty-minute meeting, however, is similar to the TAT model.
