PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIE 1-‘OR TEACHERS
Schools which sueoessfully include all students must employ a
range of strategim and techniques so teachers can gain the
support they need. The teacher-helping-teacher problem sol-
ving strateg has proven to be an eﬂecﬁve method of creating
open, productive eoll aboraﬁve oonsultation among educators.
We have developed and reﬁned the strateg over several
years. It has been particularly useful as we have implemented
integrated or inclusionary programs for all students.
The ﬁmdamental principle of the pi is that teachers
can he-Lp other tmchers. Problem solving proceeds through an
orderly sequence of steps fmm the  dedgnation of the
problem to the development and implementation of a plan to
resolve it, toevaluation ofpnog'ress,tomonitoring. Theprooess
is dynamic, evolving, ﬂeﬁble, and cyclical in nature.
