<p>The author notes that although &#8220;the integration of disabled people is
accepted in principle in today&#8217;s society, entrenched in the <em>Charter of
rights and Freedoms</em>, and championed by human rights organizations,&#8221; it
is not always practised.</p>

This article describes the case of <em>Elwood et. cl. versus the Halifax-County
Bedford District School Board</em>. One family, through legal counsel,
achieved integrated class placement for their son, Luke. The author
outlines the main terms of the Settlement Agreement which addressed all
parental concerns and forestalled a court action based on the <em>Charter of
Rights</em>. The enthusiasm of Luke&#8217;s classmates and their parents for his
integrated placement reflects growing community support for educational
integration.</p>
