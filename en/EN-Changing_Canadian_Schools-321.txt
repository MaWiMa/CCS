The positive experience of partial integration in Grade 7 led the parents
of Yvonne Penner to request a totally integrated Grade 8 program at her
St.Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland school. This article describes Yvonne's
accomplishments in communication skills, interpersonal relationships, and
educational goals.

Her parents conclude, "`We commend the school board for taking the
courageous step of total intqration and not falling into the readiness
trap. Children are always ready -- they just need the appropriate
supports.`"

This article follows five children whose preschool years included
intensive developmental programming in their own homes as part of the

integrated into regular primary school classes. The article notes that,
"`As long as adequate supports are provided, the viability of such an
educational option is no longer in question.`"
