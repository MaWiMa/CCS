individualization and appropriate supports, alter almost
twenty years of experience with an integrated systm.
The author notes that the importanm of Italy’s experience
is that “they have done it  They have maﬁ and continue to
make systemic ch? that encourage the valuing of all
young people  that make it posﬁble to simply stop separaﬁng
people and then work on the problems as they arise.” In this
way, integration is presented, not as a singular event, but as
an eﬂhrt that “will never be ﬁnished”

This chapter presents a rationale for the integration of stu-
dents with handicaps into the regular school, listing bene-ﬁts
for the integated child, the family, students without disabili-
ties, and professional stall‘. The authors maintain that, in the
United States, integratim practice lags behind federal law
and that a mﬁor barrier is “philosophical inertia”.
They conclude that, “While students with the most pro-
found disabilitim may pose particular integration challenges
for schools and parents, their inclusion is not less possible nor
less important than that of students with milder disabilities
being placed into regular public school.”

This article challenges the usefulness of the integ-ation vs.
segregation debate. Ideological arguments which themselvw
constitute barriers to integration include manipulation of the
phrase “best interests of the child”, an attitude of defeaﬁsm,
the “limited time and enen-9'” argument, fear of social rejection
