The M&R teacher will assist the classroom teacher in reporting to parents;
he or she will also consult with parents on any matters regarding their
child which arises in the classroom.

*_Attendants and Aides_* +
Other members of the support team within a school include attendants, who
are available to help with children with total care needs such as feeding
and taileting. Aides, on the other hand, generally assist in the amdemic
program. Both attendants and aides receive their instructions from the
classroom teacher who remains responsible for the programs and students
in the class. The classroom teacher may also seek support from psychologists,
speech pathologists, diagnosticians, specialists for children who are
blind or deaf, and sometimes physiotherapists.

When problems arise, the classroom teacher can request that a problem-solving
team be formed by the M&R staff. The team is a problem-solving unit made
up of volunteer staff members

(see Chapter 12).
Frequently, the team includes the school guidance counsellor, district
psychologists, a member of the administration, and, of course, the M&R
staff.

The team approaches the problem using a prescribed plan, and offers a series
of possible options for the classroom teacher. Follow-up sessions are
arranged to provide the teacher with continued support if needed.

These resources help teachers do the best possible job. A close working
relationship with people in these supportive roles ensures that the
student with special needs will be assessed accurately and that feasible
programs will be drawn up which are implemented properly. A close
relationship also makes teachers feel that they are not alone; the value
of that support is immeasurable.
