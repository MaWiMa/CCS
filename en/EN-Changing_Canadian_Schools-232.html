<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> The facilitator and the referring teacher went over
the suggestions and the referring teacher assigned either
number 1: an idea to try immediately; number 2: a good idea,
but not a priority; or number 3: an idea that has already been
tried or would not work. In this case, the referring teacher
choose three ideas to try immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 6:</strong> The facilitator assisted the referring teacher in
establishing the following action plan:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The methods and resource teacher will arrange and participate
in a meeting with Amanda&#8217;s parents to discuss her progress to date
and to begin formulating a plan for her success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanda will begin repeated readings. The methods and resource
teacher will supply a one-hundred-word passage each week and a chart
to record the mistakes and time the exercise takes each day. Since
these will both decrease, this activity will give Amanda a sense of
accomplishment and greater self-confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanda will write daily about herself (about My Favourite Pet,
What I Like About My Friend&#8217;s House, My Favourite Holiday). This
exercise will be short and will be marked and returned to Amanda
with constructive criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A follow-up meeting will take place in four weeks to review progess.</p>
</li>
</ol>
