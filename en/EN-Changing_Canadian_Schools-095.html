<p>Mandy enrolled me in a world of battle, a world I new nothing about.
This was especially true of our educational system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>People&#8217;s attitudes proved to be one of the greatest barriers. People felt
that Mandy had to master an array of skills before she could join the lives
of neighbours, friends and schoolmates. I was told that people needed time
to get &#8220;ready&#8221;, and attitudes needed to &#8220;change&#8221; before she could be accepted
into their schools. In other words, positive attitudes of the community
and of the teachers were requisite for Mandy to attend school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I believed that Mandy could not wait for people&#8217;s attitudes to change.
I felt she belonged in the regular school system with her peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Mandy was four years old, our family was transferred to Ottawa, Ontario.
I enrolled Mandy in a nursery school for special needs children. I grappled
with my conscience at doing this, and, after monitoring Mandy&#8217;s progress
for several months, I gave in to the gnawing feeling that she was in the
wrong place. How was she going to make friends in her neighbourhood and
learn to cope with everyday situations if she was segregated from other
children?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After making many inquiries, I arranged for Mandy to attend a local daycare
centre that had set aside three seats in their program for children with
mental handicaps. Mandy spent an exciting year there. As she blossomed we
saw many changes in her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of this year, much to our disappointment, Mandy was denied access
to the junior kindergarten program in the same school as the daycare centre.
The teacher did not feel she could handle a child with a handicap in her
classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This threw me into indecision. Did Mandy really deserve the same things
other children took for granted? Was I being realistic?
I wondered if I should I just give up&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which would have been the easier
route&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or if I should persevere, doing what I felt was right for Mandy
and helping others to see Mandy as I did.</p>
