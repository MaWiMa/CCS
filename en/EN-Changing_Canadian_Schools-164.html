<p>One teacher summed it up: &#8220;It was helpful this year when I was told by
others that it was alright to have different expectations for my special
needs students. Then I finally felt the pressure was off.&#8221;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many principals and teachers indicated that, in retrospect, it was the special
education teacher who had the most difficulty changing roles to accommodate
integration. The special education teacher in one school needed to &#8220;let go&#8221;
of the special education students and the self-contained classroom. One teacher,
who had an exceptional student in her special education class for eleven
years, said she &#8220;needed preparation and time to learn how to &#8216;let go&#8217;
and to trust other educators with her exceptional students.&#8221; There was an
obvious need for support in overcoming these apprehensions and it was recommended
that the principal be responsible for preparing school staff including the
special education teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most effective and beneficial ways to prepare staff is by providing
school-based training, which can be used to assess and address the needs
of individual teachers. It is also helpful to have articles, books and video
tapes available for staff to read and view. Sharing, problem-solving sessions,
and school and class visitations were also identified as useful means to
teach about integration and inclusion.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The educators recommended that the use of school resources be expanded when
integrating exceptional students and that school administrators be flexible
and creative in using school resources. For example, a teacher who uses
cooperative learniing strategies may lend a hand in integration along with
the methods and resource teacher.</p>
