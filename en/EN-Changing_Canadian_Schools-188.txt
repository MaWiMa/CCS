tohlp. Methods and resource (M&R) teachers (see Chapter 8)
are, ﬁrst and foremost, experienmd classroom washers who
have mmived addiﬁonal training in areas such as student
assmment, Inﬁvidual Education Plans (IEPs) and multi-
level instruction. They provide the teachers with ass istance
in: asmment, planning, instruction and evaluation for stu-
dents with special pmpsm nwds. An important working
relationship en'sts hetmn the classroom teacher and the
methods and resource teacher.
Anenmenl: Astudent with special needsis usually identiﬁed
upon entry into the school system, and, as that student moves
thmugh the system, his or her ﬁle is updated frequently. Ifnew
problems or circumstances arise, the teacher gathers informa-
tion on the child and oonsults with the M&R teacher. At this
point, the M&R teacher reviews the program neeh of the
stud ant and decides if new or furthm' assessment is necessary.
It is important to note that much of the assessment is done
through observation rather than formal tesﬁng. The M&R
teacher reviews the informaﬁon and makes rmmmenda-»
tions.
Program adiustmenl: The M&R teacher and the classroom
teacher develop an IEP for the student which includes recom-
mendations from the assessment. Together they modify the
regular program or develop special prmrams to meet the
studentfs needs.
