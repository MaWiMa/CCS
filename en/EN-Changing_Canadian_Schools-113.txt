Teachers want to talk about the child who isn't moulding in with everyone
else. He or she is just not doing well. Sometimes the teacher just needs
to ask "`why isn't he getting it?`" The teacher doesn't understand the child's
inconsistencies and wants to talk it over.

[The teachers] need support. They want to know that what they're doing is 
right. Even teachers who have been at it a while were saying, at the first
of the year, "`We don't hnow how to handle [integration of students with
disabilities]. I've never had to deal with this before.`" When I simply
out lined what the objective was for the student in the class they took
right off. It's amazing. They're doing it right and I just provide a lot
of positive reinforcement. For example, I tell them, "`You don't need my
help, you know what you're doing a you're doing a good job`"

Sometimes teachers really need a practical suggestion, some little thing
that clicks for them. Sometimes it is related to the student and sometimes
to the teacher. Maybe it's an adjustment of teaching style, and the suggestions
you make don't fit their style. You have to know what their style of teaching
is to really reach them.

Meetings! A lot of meetings! That's part of the planning, of course. You
meet with parents, you meet with teachers, teacher's aides and others.
You'd like to have more time to yourself, but you're usually in meetings,
I find.

This typifies the role of a teacher acting as a consultant in a school.
The major actities identified by methods and resource teachers usually
involve partnership with other teachers. This includes extensive discussions
with the teacher about the student's difficulty and needs, and content and
structure of the individual program.

The work of methods and resource teachers is highly varied, with requirements
changing all the time, and people relying on their assistance daily. For
these reasons, M&R teachers reported, they have to be both flexible and
responsive so they can be available when the teacher needs support, which
means they must plan their time very carefully.
