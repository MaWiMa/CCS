<p>They have to be ready to listen to all problems, no matter how simple,
and give immediate assistance. At the same time they have to be prepared
to respond to the crises which arise in schools everyday:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to find ways of being there. Teachers don&#8217;t always like to arrange
meetings, but they like to drop in. Maybe you&#8217;re right in the middle of
something, but you have to make yourself available for them when they&#8217;re
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the methods and resource role you can plan a day, but very often you can
only get into a couple of things that you want todo. So you have to be on
your toes and be able to be versatile, to change your plans on the spot.
In the classroom it&#8217;s a much more organized day. You know exactly
what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>

<p>The M&amp;R teacher also helps the teacher initiate the integration program
for a particular student and get it started in the classroom. One former
M&amp;R teacher said:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had to make sure that the teacher had enough resources to work with.
Also, if teachers were having any difficulty, I would see how I could assist
them in making it easier for the child to participate in the classroom.
I had to be in the classrooms at times monitoring what was going on and the
way things were being handled&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;how the teacher and the student were adjusting
and if there were any difficulties.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A final activity that involves considerable time, particularly for M&amp;R teachers
working at the junior and senior high school levels, is actually planning
and coordinating the overall schedule of exceptional students. Students
with disabilities attending high school can find it particularly difficult
to have a focus for the day at school.</p>
