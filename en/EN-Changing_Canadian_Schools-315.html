<p>Common misunderstandinsg, goals and practical step for integration are
outlined in five sections: 1) the family&#8217;s expectations; 2) enlisting
the help of the neighbourhood school principal; 3) enrolling the teacher;
4) involving classmates; and 5) the making of action plans (MAPs). The
placement of an integration consultant or facilitator in the school is
advocated.</p>

with profound disabilities. In Brown, Fredda and Donna H. Lehr. <em>Persons

The chapter discusses the rationale for integration in terms of the
benefits for all concerned: students with severe and profound
disabilities (including those with multiple handicaps
and medically fragile conditions), their families, students without
disabilities and professional staff. Sections also focus on strategies
for obtaining integrated programs and barriers to their implementation.</p>
