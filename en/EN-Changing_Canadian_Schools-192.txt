=== Implementing Multi-Level Instruction: Strategies for Classroom Teachers

_by Jean Collicott_

The classroom teacher always, ultimately, controls the expectations and
accomplishments of the students for whom he or she is responsible. Five
years of experience in the integration of children with disabilities into
regular classrooms has shown me that the teacher who sets an example for
others, especially students, in the acceptance of children with disabilities
and mental handicaps in the regular classroom.

Where teachers have taken the initiative in accepting a child with a
disability and are actively working to promote acceptance and interaction,
the child has been accepted by peers in the classroom. Conversely, when a
child with a disability has been supported entirely by a teacher assistant,
with minimal teacher interaction, he or she has not become a true member
of the class.

Therefore, it is vitally important that the teacher develop strategies
for involving all children in classroom activities so all students will
be seen as valuable members of the class.

Since it is impossible and indeed not even desirable for a classroom
teacher to spend a great amount of time working individually with an
exceptional student, it is necessary to focus on accommodating the
exceptional student's instruction with other students.
