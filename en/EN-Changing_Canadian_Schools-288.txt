Cafeteria cashiers learned to slow the pace down to allow people time to
count out their money. One cashier even ran a tab to accommodate a
favourite student who loved the fish and chips platter but did not always
have enough money to pay for it. How that till was balanced every night
is still a mystery!

*_Parent Advocacy_* +
Parents have been involved since the founding of the Humber program and
they now play a pivotal role on the Advisory Committee. Some people
question the appropriateness of involving parents, knowing how most
college students are fairly independent of their families. Despite these
doubts, parent support is essential, and communication between parents
and faculty has become an accepted part of the daily routine.

Many parents, well on their way to burn-out after twenty or more years of
advocacy and struggle, now watch their sons and daughters thrive in
college. It brings them new energy and fresh resolve for facing the
impending question of work.
Somehow the posibilities for their children seem greater than before.
They see improved self-confidence and motivation in their children.
Several said this was the first time their son or daughter saw him or
herself as someone who could make a contribution and have a place in
society. One father, commenting on his son's daily telephone conversation
with a longstanding friend, said he could not get over the growth of his
son's vocabulary and how much more worldly he was in his conversation.

Students supported by CICE certainly benefitted, and so did their peers,
as is obvious in the testimonial of a human services student:

//When I first learned I was going to do a placement with CICE I was not
//exactly excited. I'm not patient enough, --> page 289
