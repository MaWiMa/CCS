child: Attitudes of teachers and non-teachers. <em>Canadian Journal for
Exceptional Children</em>, 1(1), pp. 23-26.*<br>
An attitude survey reveals that regular classroom teachers question their
own competence to teach a child with special needs. They also fear
increased time demands and worry about dilution of the academic content
of their programs. This article calls for a continued focus on staff
development on integration issues, since the regular classroom teacher
&#8220;is the indispensable professional who will carry the primary
responsibility for integrating the exceptional child.&#8221;</p>

for Mainstreaming: Integrating students with moderate to revere
disabilities</em>. Rockville, MD: Aspen Publishers.</strong>
This hook begins with the assumption that integrating children with
moderate to severe disabilities depends more upon the attitudes and
problem-solving skills of the educators than on the skills of the
students. The first section focuses on the values and philosophy of
integration and discusses models for change within the school system.
The second section describes integration efforts in school systems across
the U.S.. These include accounts of innovative practices, successes,
failures and the particular challenges presented by different
disabilities.</p>
