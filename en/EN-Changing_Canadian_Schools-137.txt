There's not much of an emphasis on concrete learning. Instead there's an
emphasis on sitting at the desk in rows and listening to the teacher, taking
the notes, being able to regurgitate the information. Teachers are getting
these kids ready for college or for technical school and don't have time
for anybody else. Project work is limited. Teachers don't like to vary from
the curriculum. They don't like to see another way. They're not looking at
what the student needs at this particular time I find it difficult to get
teachers to understand.

==== The Challenge of Working with Teachers
The constant search for effective ways to work with regular classroom teachers
is one of the major challenges identified by methods and resource teachers.
One M&R teacher explains that classroom teachers have "`different personalities,
different knowledge and experience.`" They tend to practice their
profession in isolation, developing their own approaches to instruction
for students with special needs. The M&R teacher must find ways to work
as an effective collaborator and problem-solver with each individual teacher.
Classroom teachers must be specific about both the kind of help and level
of support they expect from the M&R teacher. They must also provide the M&R
teacher with feedback on the usefulness of strategies being used. Open
communication is necessary if the relationship is to work:

confidence that they can do what they think they should do.
