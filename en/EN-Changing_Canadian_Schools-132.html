<p>One of the most important contributions the principal can make is to present
and clearly define the role of the M&amp;R teacher to the members of the school
staff and communicate his or her support of the M&amp;R program. Principals
also need to be involved sufficiently to show ownership of integration efforts.
This will motivate other staff members to do the same:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The principal has to really know what is going on. He has to be behind it
and believe in the program. Because if you have little breakdowns you have
to have the support. You have to have the back up all the way down the line,
otherwise the system will fail.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This level of support is not always present, however. Some M&amp;R teachers
reported that they found principals treating the program with what might
be called benign neglect, out of either lack of confidence or lack of interest:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If [the principal] was interested, [in the prgram] it would help. But since
the beginning of the year there has been nothing said. If the principal
brought it up, teachers would see that he&#8217;s monitoring it. He could even
go into the classes where special needs students are and see how things
are going and ask the teachers for copies of the objectives. He could ask
the teachers how they&#8217;re doing with the program. It would be so much more
effective if he was [monitoring the programs].</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Principals have a strong influence on the efforts of the M&amp;R teacher and
can seriously undermine the program. With the principal&#8217;s positive support
and collaboration the M&amp;R teacher can act confidently to help teachers meet
student needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher also needs the principal to listen to his or her concerns
and take action when required. Issues of authority sometimes come up when
teachers are asked to collaborate with M&amp;R teachers.</p>
