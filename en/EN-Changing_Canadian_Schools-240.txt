==== FACTORS OF SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION

We have identified many important factors which contribute to the success
of integration: the belief that all students are
capable of learning; the day-to-day modelling of effective leadership; an
in-school approach to problem solving; and the inclusion of parents in
the planning process. These are contributing factors; they set the stage
for integration. They do not, however, guarantee the same quality of
learning and the increased social relationships which exist in classrooms
where teachers deliberately plan for peer interaction and for participation
of students with disabilities in regular curriculum activities.

==== SUPPORT IN BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS

*_The Importance of Friendships_* +
Full inclusion in the integrated school depends on the recognition that
supporting students to build relationships with their peers is a critical
aspect of school life. Teachers who have had experience in integrating
students with disabilities acknowledge that students who are accepted,
liked and involved with their peers show gains in academic, social and
physical development.

Students who have spent years in segregated, "`handicapped only`" settings
have been denied opportunities to form the social relationships enjoyed
by their non-handicapped peers. Depending on the nature of the student's
disabilities, relationships formed in special classes tend to be adult-child
rather than child-child relationships. They are dependent relationships
rather than friendships born of mutual interest, attraction, or common
skills. Relationships formed in segregated settings also tend to be
one-sided helping relationships that are usually not reciprocal in nature.
Teachers help students, but there is little possibility for students to
help teachers or peers.
