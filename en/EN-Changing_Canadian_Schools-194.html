<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to develop a lesson that meets these objectives,
teachers may use the following four-step process as a guide:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>identify the underlying concepts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the teacher method of presentation (teaching style, questioning
techniques, partial participation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the student method of practice (allowing for variation in
assignments based on Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, different presentation modes, and
partial participation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the method of student evaluation (considering different levels
of skill and accepting a variety of evaluation procedures).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_step_one_identification_of_underlying_concepts">STEP ONE: IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERLYING CONCEPTS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step is to identify the underlying concepts to be taught within
a unit or a particular lesson. It is important to understand that underlying
concepts are not merely the objectives established for a particular course.
Objectives may be only part of a much broader picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers must identify, in the material they are teaching, what they would
like all the students in the class to understand when the lesson has
been completed.</p>
