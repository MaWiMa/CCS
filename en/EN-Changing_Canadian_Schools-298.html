Quality education for all</em>. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brooks Publishing Co.</strong><br>

of the broader school reform movement. The chapters address the question

poses a basic challenge to the conception and design of education
programs in general.</p>

<p>The models discussed here have two major factors in common: 1) the
acceptance of responsibility by the classroom teacher for a diverse group
of students; and 2) an understanding of such diversity as meeting
opportunity and not difficulty. Included are chapters on accommodating
student diversity through the curriculum, peer relations in the classroom,
teacher preparation, degrees of disability, and parental roles.</p>
