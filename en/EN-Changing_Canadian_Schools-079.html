<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his last year at school, Grade 12, our son, John, who has Down Syndrome, was fully integrated for the first time into regular
classrooms. He spent only two hours a week outside the regular class when he practised reading and speaking with a teacher.
He also attended job sites under a work-study program. Parents should note that it is important to have a definition of
integration which permits and encourages things like work-study programs; some definitions I have heard would prevent them if
taken literally. In fact, John had a better time in Grade 12 than did his older sister or younger brother. This was not an
accident; it came about in part because of a great deal of learning on our&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;his parents&#8217;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;part and on the part of some
teachers and administrators, to whom we pay tribute. What we learned made us seriously question much of the ideology and many
of the theories upon which the special education system is based.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we began to think about the kind of education our child with Down Syndrome needed, it was 1978, when the jargon we now use
was unknown in New Brunswick. As we felt that what was going on wasn&#8217;t appropriate, we had to learn to explain what we wanted
in ways the people in the system would understand and respect.</p>
