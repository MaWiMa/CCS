Although nine-year-old Sabrina was labelled autistic and severely to
profoundly retarded, she experienced remarkable progress in an
individualized program within a regular Grade 4/5 classroom. A major
concern of staff was the possible rejection of Sabrina because of her
anti-social behaviour. However, they found that a consistent approach
and the natural acceptance of her peers led to significant growth. This
article supports the view that school systems can and will change as
they see integration working.

This article documents the experience of one school board in Ontario
which made a policy commitment to "`move all children into their
neighbourhood schools with appropriate services.`" Four schools -- two
elementary and two secondary -- initially served as models for the entire
system. The experiences of two students and their teacher/integration
facilitator are described. The authors pose the question, "`If one board
can do it why can't they all?`"
