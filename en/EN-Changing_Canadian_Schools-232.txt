. Make Amanda responsible for fewer questions than the
rest of the class.
. Have her write daily about herself. It should be short and should
be marked and returned with constructive criticism.
. Praise her for good health.
. Have someone read to her every day.
. Have Amanda repeat directions to make sure that she understands what
is expected of her.
. Have her write with a peer.
. Use the Specific Skills Series reading comprehension book.
. Plan a time every day to check on her organization.

*Stage 5:* The facilitator and the referring teacher went over
the suggestions and the referring teacher assigned either
number 1: an idea to try immediately; number 2: a good idea,
but not a priority; or number 3: an idea that has already been
tried or would not work. In this case, the referring teacher
choose three ideas to try immediately.

*Stage 6:* The facilitator assisted the referring teacher in
establishing the following action plan:

. The methods and resource teacher will arrange and participate
in a meeting with Amanda's parents to discuss her progress to date
and to begin formulating a plan for her success.
. Amanda will begin repeated readings. The methods and resource
teacher will supply a one-hundred-word passage each week and a chart
to record the mistakes and time the exercise takes each day. Since
these will both decrease, this activity will give Amanda a sense of
accomplishment and greater self-confidence.
. Amanda will write daily about herself (about My Favourite Pet,
What I Like About My Friend's House, My Favourite Holiday). This
exercise will be short and will be marked and returned to Amanda
with constructive criticism.
. A follow-up meeting will take place in four weeks to review progess.
