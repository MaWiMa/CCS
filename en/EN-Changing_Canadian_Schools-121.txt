In addition, M&R teachers need a thorough knowledge of the available
instructional materials and resources that can be utilized to the best
advantage in the student's program. This makes a background in special
education useful. However, most of the teachers felt that these things
could be learned on the job.

Materials have to be assembled and paperwork completed while monitoring

There has to be on underlying organization to what you're doing and you
have to have a long range plan of what you expect in the next two or three
months.

I've learned that I have to be very organized. If I'm not, and I think this
is one of the problems I had last year, I just keep thinking there's so
much I've got to do and I just have a sense of panic. This year I've learned
that I have to be organized, deal with what I think is most important and
work my way through. Sometimes I don't get to the bottom of the list but
I've found being organized has helped me a lot.

Teachers have different teaching styles and students have different learning
styles, meaning M&R teachers need a thorough knowledge of alternate teaching
strategies in addition to the school curriculum. They must have a sense of
what approach is likely to be most successful with an individual teacher
or student. At the elementary level, knowledge in reading, language arts
and mathematics is considered the most important. At the junior and senior
high levels more attention is paid to course content in social studies,
sience and vocational subjects.
