<p>When collaboration is a problem, M&amp;R teachers need a good relationship with
the school pincipal to resolve a situation successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to being up-to-date on critical issues and informed as to planning
programs, principals must take the lead in identifying students and teachers
who need the support of the M&amp;R teacher:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had a situation where a student was placed in a classroom where the teacher
wasn&#8217;t really sold on the idea. The principal said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve really got to
make this situation work, because if it doesn&#8217;t, it will make it
difficult for all of us.&#8221; So the principal and I have gone out of our way
to make sure the program has been a successful experience for the teacher.
We&#8217;ve involved her in workshops and given her time out to prepare matirials.
We&#8217;ve supported her every way we can and it&#8217;s worked very well. The teacher
now believes that it is working and can see changes in the student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one instance, a teacher was having a lot of misgivings about having an
exceptional student in the room. She felt the support she had was going
to be taken away, and I had a hard time convincing her that she head to play
a part in meeting the needs of the student. She didn&#8217;t feel she could do
that, so I left it at that point. I didn&#8217;t feel it was my role to push it
with her any more. I talked to the principal and asked him to access the
situation from his point of view. In his regular classroom visitation, he
was able to get the same point across and after a few weeks
the teacher was coming to me and saying &#8220;I worked with him [the child]
today and it was great.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher can benefit from the advice and guidance of the school principal.
This does not mean blind support for everything the M&amp;R teacher does, but
a collaborative approach to problem-solving based on mutual respect.</p>
