<p><em>by Gordon L. Porter</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since 1985, schools in New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29 have been
using an inclusive approach to educate students with disabilities (Porter, 1986).
This has required a number of changes in policies and goals, organizational
structures, instructional strategies, and support mechanisms. However, the
single most significant change has been the redefinition of the school-based
special education teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this new position, we adopted the term methods and resource teacher
(M&amp;R teacher), from the Wellington County Separate School Board in Guelph,
Ontario (Forest, 1984). We have invested considerable effort in definig
the role and in training people for the position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers are primarily responsible for providing direct
and effective support to classroom teachers, with the goal of enabling <em>all</em>
students to be meaningfully included in learning activities in regular classrooms.
M&amp;R teachers have a secondary responsibility to &#8220;exceptional&#8221; students
who require individualized supports and services to participate in and benefit
from regular classroom instruction.</p>
