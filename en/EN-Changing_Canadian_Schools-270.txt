4. The group may need tommt regularly. This can M at lunch
or at a special outing. The purpose of the meetings is to
structure the group enough, at the beginning, to encourage
a sense of unity and a spirit of interacﬁon. The meeting
are a forum where people get to know one another better;
the group then provides an opportunity to break the
rig'dity of existing peer cliques and to form new relan'on-
ships. When people become accustomed to meeting they will
continue, generally with little encouragement or direction
GENTLE TEACHING IN THE CLASSROOM
Total inclusion in Sue's school meant that, at some level,
everyone in her school interacted with her. Students, through
the peer group, were developing friendships with Sue, but
mmt adults were uncomfortable worﬁng directly with Sue
because of her challenging behaviour. As a result, only a few
people who had “ways of dealing with her” had developed a
relationship with her. Given her challenging behaviotu, they
were perceived as having some special ability. We needed to
give adults a way to develop good relationships with her.
We chose Gentle Teaching (McGee et al, 1987), which
presented a set of common strategies to fadlitate meaningful
dialogue between Sue and those who worked with her in the
school. It enabled people to work with Sue to control and
redirect her challengng behaviour, which in tum imp-noved
their relationships with her.
