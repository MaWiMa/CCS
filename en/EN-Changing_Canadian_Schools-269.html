<p>Students got to know others better. Initially, the group came together
to help Sue but in the process they got to know each other better. For
instance, at first Scott described Eric as a goof and the class clown.
But as they spent time together because of Sue, he came to see that Eric
was actually quite serious.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peer groups are as unique as the individual students in them. There is
no one way of forming groups, but here are some points worth
consideration:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Students need to be asked to participate in solving problematic
situations. They quickly learn to become passive in an adult-centred world
which tries to solve all their problems for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The class may need to be involved in discussions and reach a consensus
that there is a problem for one of the students. For someone with special
needs it could be an issue of inclusion. For the at-risk student it could
be strategies to help the student attend classes. For the student who
just moved to the school it can be how to make them feel welcome. By
discussing and comparing prior experiences to the current problematic
situations, students will come to see that they already know solutions.
For example, students can be encouraged to examine how a stranger is made
welcome in their home. In the process of decreasing the gap between the
way things are and the way they should be, children come up with rich
alternate strategies.
This process brings out values of equity that the children know about but
may never have acted on before. It provides the peer group with a rationale
and may benefit all students who lack adequate peer support and inclusion,
not just the student in question.</p>
