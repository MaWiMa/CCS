<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated previously, both the regular class and methods and resource teachers
need support from the school administrators in implementing integration.
Initially, the methods and resource teacher may have to assist the regular
class teacher in a variety of ways such as by providing more planning time
and consultation. In order that this be carried out effectively, the principal
should help with planning, organization and scheduling so that the classroom
teachers can be released for specific periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many principals said they have found it important to select methods and
resource teachers who are able to assume some leadership and to collaborate
effectively with staff and parents. Principals also tend to rely on the
expertise of their methods and resource teachers. As one principal stated,
however, &#8220;Even though I rely on my methods and resource teacher to provide
leadership in integrating our exceptional students, I feel it is my responsibility
to keep in close contact with her so that I can provide the necessary support.&#8221;</p>

<h5 id="_assign_teacher_assistants">Assign Teacher Assistants</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the outset of many integration programs, teacher assistants were often
assigned to individual exceptional students. As a result, the teacher assistants
often took on &#8220;ownership&#8221; of the exceptional students who were assigned
to them. Consequently, the classroom teachers&#8217; role in educating these exceptional
students diminished and the students became more and more isolated in the
regular class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to prevent this situation, the educators recommended that the teacher
assistant be assigned to the teacher rather than the student. The teacher
would then be responsible for making sure the teacher assistant helped the
class in a variety of ways and became an integral part of the class.</p>
