7. If Sue should hit us as we attempted to engage her, we
would protect ourselws by hlocking the hits, but no out-
ward attention would he gran to the behaviour. We would
continue to interact and resume the value-giving, the
touches, and the praise with the activity;

important that she learn to reciprocate value to us. Inter-
actions needed to be mutually rewarding. Therefore, ges-

The main objectives were dedded upon, based on all of the

praise given needed to be increased, to impiws the message
that she was safe and secure with us. The words spoken to her
were to give her reason to look at us and anticipate our next
action, which would keep the momentum of the interaction

room in a more organized fashion. Unused materials needed
to be put away, the furniture needed to be arranged to inhibit
her climbing. and we had to pay attention to her tendency to
run out of the room.

they are time-tested approaches that have been used by
caregivers for years.
The new approaches were tested and the group felt that
they had accomplished what they had set out to do. They were
