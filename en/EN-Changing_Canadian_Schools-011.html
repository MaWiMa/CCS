<p>We know from a lot of research that knowledge of the change process is
also crucial (Fullan, 1991).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the key obstacles to reform include the problems of <em>complexity,
compatibility, capability</em>, and lack of coordinated <em>leadership</em>. Special
education reform reflects all of these problems. The solutions to inclusion
are not easily achieved. It is complex both in the nature and degree of
change required to identify and implement solutions that work. Philosophical
and pedagogical ideas in the debate about inclusion are often in conflict
and perceived to be incompatible so that we are dealing with changes in
belief systems. Capability or the degree of skill and know-how is a
perennial central problem of change. This is why continuous in-service
education or professional development is a critical strategy. Given what
change requires&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;persistence, coordination, follow-up, conflict resolution,
and the like&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;leadership at all levels is required including teacher
leaders, school administrators, school board consultants, parent leaders
and provincial ministries.</p>

<p>The ideas in <em>Changing Canadian Schools</em> provide ample insight for addressing
the above obstacles to reform. Above all, the book demonstrates that we
should not wait for someone else to take the first step. It takes <em>each
individual</em> pushing for needed change. When many individuals begin
pushing in the same direction they begin to intersect, and influence others
along the way. We have in this book a compilation of the struggles and
success stories of such individuals whose efforts have begun to add up
and to make a substantial difference and improvement in educational practice.</p>
