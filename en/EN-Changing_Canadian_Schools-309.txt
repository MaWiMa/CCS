Teachers can play a critical role in making integration work if they have
support from administrators, teachers and parents. They also need practial
strategies and principles with which to work.

This chapter outlines three basic principles which can provide the
foundation for successful integration: 1) a commitment to integration as
a value; 2) use of a functional curriculum model; and 3) community
referenced instruction.

By integrating personnel, programs and resources in special and regular
education departments, colleges and universities can set the stage for a
unified regular education system for elentary and secondary schools. 
This chapter suggests steps for doing it, including a "`common
professional core of courses for all educators`" and "`community
referenced curricular content.`"

Thirty-seven teachers read and discussed information related to the
integration of students with severe handicaps into regular schools. The
results of this study indicate that teachers`' attitudes and behavioural
intentions regarding this issue can be significantly influenced by such
a program of reading and discussion.
