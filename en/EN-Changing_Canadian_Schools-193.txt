//necessary to focus on accommodating the exceptional student's instruction with other students. (Campbell, Campbell, Collicott, Perner and Stone, 1988) <-- page 192
In order to make this accommodation within a single classroom setting,
teachers are now challenged with the task of restructuring their classroom
practice. As an alternative to preparing and teaching a number of different
lessons within a single class, teachers must develop a framework for planning
that allows for one main lesson with varying methods of presentation,
practise, and evaluation. Multi-level instruction is one approach to the
development of this framework.

==== WHAT IS MULTI-LEVEL INSTRUCTION?
Multi-level instruction (Schulz and Turnhull, 1984) is based on the premise
that one lesson will be taught to the whole class. It is an approach to
planning that assumes the individualization, flexibility and inclusion of
all students regardless of their personal level of skills. It allows the
teacher to plan for all students within one lesson, thereby decreasing
the necessity for separate programs while allowing the teacher to weave
individual goals into the classroom content and instructional strategies.

In order to achieve this, teachers need to fully understand the concept
of multi-level teaching strategies. To develop a unit or a lesson that is
truly multi-level, the lesson must have a definite aim for all students.
It must also include a variety of teacher techniques aimed at reaching
students at all levels. This means:

* considering student learning styles when planning presentation methods;

* involving them in the lesson through questioning aimed at differerent
levels of thinking (e.g., Bloom's Taxonomy, a taxonomy of levels of
cognitive difficulty developed by Beniamin Bloom, a psychologist and
educational theorist at the University of Chicago, (see page 197);
