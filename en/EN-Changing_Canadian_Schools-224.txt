The facilitator must ensure that the atmosphere remains supportive and
non-judgemental. The facilitator must identify possible participants,
schedule the meeting and ensure that teachers share their expertise and
knowledge so creative solutions emerge. He or she must also assist the
teacher in selecting stratagies for possible use, in developing an evaluation
plan, and in follow-up and implementation.

*_Addressing the System_* +
Regular use of problem solving leads educators to look beyond the immediate
situation to prevention and, ultimately, to issues related to the organization
of the school. School organization can bring about many day-to-day problems
food by students and teachers (Skrtic, 1991). The connection between a
student's problem and system variables that may be contributing to the
problem or preventng solutions must be identified and dealt with.
Educators cannot assume that problems are only internal to the child.
This perspective shifts the focus and broadens the goals of the consultation
or problem-solving process (Gutkin and Hickman, 1990).

*_Empowerment_* +
The empowerment of regular classroom teachers is central to the use of
problem-solving teams. The emphasis on collaboration with peers rather
than referral to "`experts`" is an important factor in this empowerment.
Colleagues help fellow teachers clarify needs and locate resources; at
the same time they ensure that opportunities are available to constructively
resolve their own problems (West, 1990).

*_Enhancement of Student Well-Being and Performance_*
Although problem solving focuses on improving teacher's skills and performance,
the ultimate beneficiary is always intended to be the student. While the
focus is usually on one student, it is possible to see the entire school
benefit.
