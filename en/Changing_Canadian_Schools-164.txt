3. Whatwill be id ofeach teacher?
One teacher summed it up: “It was helpful this year when
I was told by others that it was alright to have diﬁerent
expectations for my swan! needs students. Then I ﬁnally felt
the pressure was oﬁ'."
Prepare All Teachers
Many prindpals and teachers indicated that, in retrwpect, it
was the special edumtion teacher who had the most diﬂiculty
changing roles to accommodate integration. The special edu-
cation teacher in one school needed to ‘let go” of the special
educatim students and the self-contained clamroom. One
teacher, who had an excepﬁonal student in her speml edum-»
tion class for eleven ymrs, said she “nwded preparation and
time to learn how to ‘let go’ and to trust othereducators with
her exoepﬁonal students.” There was an obvious need for
support in ovenmming these apprehensions and it was recom-
mended that the principal be responsible for preparing school
staﬂ' including the special education teacher.
One of the mmt effective and beneﬁcial ways to prepare
staff is by providing school-based training, which can be used
to asw and address the needs of individual teachers. It is
also helpful to have articles, books and video tapes available
for staﬂ‘ to read and view. Sharing, problem-solving sessions,
and mhool and class visitations were also identiﬁed as useful
means to teach about integration and inclusion.
Expand Resources
The educators recommended that the use of school resourms
he expanded when integrating exceptional students and that
school administrators be fleﬁble and creative in using school
resources. For example, a teacher who uses cooperative learni-
ing strategies may lend a hand in integration along with the
methods and resource teacher. When integration is being
initiated, a student may be placed in a Grade 8 class instead
