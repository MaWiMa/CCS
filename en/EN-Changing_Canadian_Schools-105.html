<p>When I was five years old, I began attending a religious program for hancapped
children. My sister, Donna, was a volunteer teacher in the class I wanted
to read. My sister said she would teach me. Our friend Lorraine gave Donna
teaching supplies to help me read. Lorraine is a teacher.</p>

<p>In September I started Mounthaven School. This was a school for children
who have a mental handicap. My brothers and sisters went to a different
school. At Christmas time, my parents went to my school for interviews with
my teachers. They told my teacher and my principal that my sister was teaching
me to read. The principal and my teacher told my parents that Donna should
not be teaching me to read. My parents believed the teacher and the principal.
They told Donna and me to stop. My parents did this because they loved me
and they didn&#8217;t want me to have problems.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was taught the same things as the other children in my class. I was taught
different things from what my brothers and sisters were taught at their
school. It made me feel miserable to be taught different things. It made
me feel that I could not do things for myself. It made me frustrated.
I felt bad about myself.</p>
