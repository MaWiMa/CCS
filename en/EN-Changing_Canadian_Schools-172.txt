For example, some schools made short videos showing how
armptional students were integrated in their claw. Other

Many prindpalsrequestwthat theirtemhers experienced
in integraﬁon be allowed to attend and make pwtaﬁons at

a real compliment.‘
CONCLUSION
In the past few years, more and more educators have gained
experience in integ-ating exceptional students in regular
classes. Many strategies have been developed and have helped
edumtorsinitiate integration and make the process successful
(Biklen, 1985; Sailor, Anderson, Halvorsen, During, Filler
and Goetz, 1989; Steinbeck and Stainback, 1989).
In New Brunswick, workshom have been held with educa-
tors experienced in integration to identify and discuss what
has helpd them. Over the course m‘ these workshops, it was
found that what was effective for one educator may not have
worked for another. Therefore, many strategies have bwn
presented here and more than one may be implemented to
assist staﬁ‘ in a particular school or school ﬁst:-ict.
