Many teachers are specific about what they want help with, while others
are puzzled by a student's lack of success and want the M&R teacher to help
determine why.

The second major area teachers want help with is classroom behaviour and
discipline. For example, a student may not pay attention in class and may
refuse to work or may refuse to work and disrupt classroom activities and
affect the learning of other students. In some cases the students have
severe behavioural disorders, which are expressed in temper tantrums, physical
and verbal abuse of classmates or teachers, or in self-abusive behaviour.

Teachers are asking for help with students who just won't do the work or
who are acting out. Sometimes you donâ€™t know whether the student is having
an academic pnoblem because of his behavioural difficulty or whether he's
a behaviour problem because he can't do the academic work:

The behaviour problems that come to me are where a child is what you might
call a lazy student. He doesn't get his work done. He's disorganized, hyperactive.
Of course, with integration we aim get emotionally disturbed or behaviour
disordened kids. I work out a plan with the teacher to decide what behaviour
we're going to target and how to deal with the behaviour.

Teachers also need moral support. One M&R teacher reports that teachers
just want to talk over their problems, discuss their ideas and get a second
opinion on what they're doing. In most cases this is done informally, in
the hallway or in the staff room:


//Teachers want to talk about the child who isn't moulding in with everyone
//else. He or she is just not doing well. Sometimes the teacher just needs
//to ask "`why isn't he getting it?`" The teacher doesn't understand the child's
//inconsistencies and wants to talk it over. --> page 113
