==== ASPECTS OF SUE'S ALIENATION
*_Behavioural Barriers_* +
At the time of our involvement, Sue was a twelve-year-old girl in Grade 5.
She attended a junior high school in a small, rural town. Sue was fortunate
in many respects. She had been in an integrated school since kindergarten
and she lived at home with her family. Her teachers made efforts to
identify her individual needs and to provide supports and resources so
that she could prosper within her classroom.

Still, Sue's schooling had a history of challenges. Sue was known as a
person who had an inclination to hurt others by matching, kicking or
hitting. She was sometimes self-abusive and, at times, engaged in
self-stimulating behaviours. Sue's behaviours prevented her from taking
part in meaningful social activities and real learning situations. They
also got in the way of any natural interactions that Sue might have had
with her peers or with adults.

Few people understood the communicative function of Sue's behaviour. Her
outbursts or temper tantrums were seen as the behaviour of a person who
was different, or as a symptom of her disobedience or lack of control.
Factors such as her behaviour, and the school's fear of injury to other
students and disruption to the class, led to measures which kept her from
her peers.

In an attempt to help her cope, Sue was given an aide. She was often seen
with her aide, studying during class time or playing solitary games during
recess or lunch. Someone was always close by keeping an eye on her. Sue
was being looked after, but rarely was there any interaction between
herself and her teacher or her neighbouring peers.

Having an aide for Sue was a mixed blessing. Over the short term, the aide
was helping to deal with immediate concerns such as Sue's tutoring,
general welfare and behaviour. But over the long term, the aide's presence
seemed to further distance Sue from those around her.
