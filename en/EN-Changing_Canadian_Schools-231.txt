*Stage 2:* The referring teacher gave a brief description of Amanda and
specified that he wanted her to improve her reading skills and to work
independently, and also to gain self-confidence.

*Stage 3:* Team members now had a chance to ask any questions for clarification.
One member wanted to know whether there was support from the home, which
there was.

*Stage 4:* During the brainstorming session all suggestions were directed
to the facilitator. The suggestions were:

. Have Amanda read to a younger student.
. Repeatd reading: have Amanda read the same story several times.
. Have her keep a journal to express her feelings.
. Meet with her parents to develop a plan.
. Make up a checklist of things that she has to do to be more organized.
She can check off each item as she completes it.
. Have her copy class rules for a display.
. Have the homeroom teacher discuss with her how important it is to ask
for help. Include peers.
. Limit homework time.
. Establish a private signal with her that will indicate that she needs
help.
. Use computer software to help with reading and writing.
. Teach Amanda the five-finger test for choosing her own reading material.
Take a book and open it to any page and as you read put a finger down for
any word you don't know.
Five fingers for one page means the book is too difficult; no fingers
means it is too easy; somewhere in between is best.
. Have Amanda present oral book reports.
. Ensure that homework is related to reading.
. Have Amanda read to a parent for fifteen minutes every night. Have them
read alternate paragraphs to each other.
. Make sure that Amanda is not singled out.
