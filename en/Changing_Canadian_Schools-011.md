# Changing Canadian Schools
We know from a lot of research that knowledge of the change process is also
crucial (Fullan, 1991).  
Some of the key obstacles to reform include the problems
of complexity, compatibility, capability, and lack of coordinated
leadership. Special education reform reflects all of these
problems. The solutions to inclusion are not easily achieved. It
is complex both in the nature and degree of change required to
identify and implement solutions that work. Philosophical and
pedagogical ideas in the debate about inclusion are often in
conflict and perceived to be incompatible so that we are dealing
with changes in beliefsystems. Capability or the degree of skill
and know-how is a perennial central problem of change.
This is why continuous in-service education or professional
development is a critical strategy. Given what change requires  
[persistens, coordination, follow-up, conflict resolution, and the like] 
leadership at all levels is required including teacher leaders,
school administrators, school board consultants, parent leaders and provincial ministries.  

The ideas in *Changing Canadian Schools* provide ample
insight for addressing the above obstacles to reform. Above
all, the book demonstrates that we should not wait for someone
else to take the first step. It takes each individual pushing for
needed change. When many individuals begin pushing in the
same direction they begin to intersect, and influence others
along the way. We have in this book a compilation of the
struggles and success stories of such individuals whose efforts
have begun to add up and to make a substantial difference and
improvement in educational practice.
