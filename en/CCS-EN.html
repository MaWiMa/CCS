<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As someone interested in issues of social reform and strategies
for change, I feel it is a special privilege to write this preface
for <em>Changing Canadian Schools</em>.
This is a very well balanced, thorough, and practical book.
Its chapters contain clear analysis of all the roles involved in
changing special education practices. It provides perspectives
and insights from the points of view of parents, administrators,
regular classroom teachers, special education resource teachers,
consultants and school board staff, and more.
Personal stories and case studies make the reading interesting,
poignant and rich. Larger scale analysis and synthesis are
also provided on the law, policy making and policy content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book contains many ideas for strategies and practical
suggestions for success. It combines advocacy with insight,
and demonstrates that both will (persistens) and skill (good
strategies) are needed for success. There is no other book of
its kind in Canada that provides such a timely and comprehensive
account of the state-of-the-art of special education reform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Special education reform represents just about all the issues
involved in bringing about educational reform. The existence
of significant social needs even when combined with
legislation is not sufficient to achieve reform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We know from a lot of research that knowledge of the change process is
also crucial (Fullan, 1991).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the key obstacles to reform include the problems of <em>complexity,
compatibility, capability</em>, and lack of coordinated <em>leadership</em>. Special
education reform reflects all of these problems. The solutions to inclusion
are not easily achieved. It is complex both in the nature and degree of
change required to identify and implement solutions that work. Philosophical
and pedagogical ideas in the debate about inclusion are often in conflict
and perceived to be incompatible so that we are dealing with changes in
belief systems. Capability or the degree of skill and know-how is a
perennial central problem of change. This is why continuous in-service
education or professional development is a critical strategy. Given what
change requires&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;persistence, coordination, follow-up, conflict resolution,
and the like&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;leadership at all levels is required including teacher
leaders, school administrators, school board consultants, parent leaders
and provincial ministries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ideas in <em>Changing Canadian Schools</em> provide ample insight for addressing
the above obstacles to reform. Above all, the book demonstrates that we
should not wait for someone else to take the first step. It takes <em>each
individual</em> pushing for needed change. When many individuals begin
pushing in the same direction they begin to intersect, and influence others
along the way. We have in this book a compilation of the struggles and
success stories of such individuals whose efforts have begun to add up
and to make a substantial difference and improvement in educational practice.</p>

<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An idea which was dismissed by all but a few educators just a decade ago
is now becoming reality in an increasing number of schools across Canada.
Students who have a disability are being educated alongside their
non-disabled peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book is designed to fill a gap in the resources available to parents,
educators and those people interested in educational policy and change.
Canada is currently at a crossroad in special education practice.
The traditional model of educating students who have a disability in
their own classrooms and schools is giving way to systems which include
all students in the same classrooms. This approach, which is mandated by
law in the province of New Brunswick, is replicated in school districts,
schools and individual classrooms all across the country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cumulative Canadian experience of inclusionary education is now
substantial. There is ample evidence that integration can and does work
for all children regardless of their disability or handicapping condition.
However, much remains to be done in order to move from present
circumstances to the point where inclusion in regular classes
in the neighbourhood school is taken for granted.
This book is meant to assist those who want to contribute to this effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 1, we have identified three factors connected to achieving
school integration:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a legal and legislative base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocacy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a vision clearly articulated and effectively
advanced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;creativ educational practice that captures the vision
and turns it into reality in classrooms and schools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each chapter in <em>Changing Canadian Schools</em> adresses one or more of these
factors. Taken together they offer a broad perspective on the issue in
question. The book&#8217;s three sections&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Philosophical, Legal and Historical
Overview; Parent and Self-Advocacy; and Innovations and Practical
Applications&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;parallel the evolution of an inclusionary approach to
schooling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The first section</strong> describes the ideals and attitudes that led to a
desire for inclusive education. Various contributors explain the social
theory and legal action that arose as people began to work towards their
ideals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The philosophical underpinnings of education integration are part of the
overall vision of rights for people who have a mental handicap.
Chapter 2 explains the vision as articulated by the Canadian Association
for Community Living. It explains that education which includes all
students is a critical foundation for building communities in which all
individuals can participate, regardless of disability.
Peter Park, a founding member of People First of Canada, an advocacy
organization of individuals who have been labelled mentally handicapped,
sums up the situation:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have to thank my father and mother for not putting me in a segregated
school back in the &#8217;50s when they were just starting. They said. &#8220;No,
you have to go to a regular school&#8221;, and I have benefitted from it. I
had regular friends, got into regular trouble, and all the things a person
does when they are growing up.
When you are in a segregated setting nobody else wants to talk to you,
nobody wants to have anything to do with you except the people that you
have daily contact with. So you don&#8217;t make friends there. You don&#8217;t know
how to conduct yourself appropriately.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The second section</strong>, Parent and Self-Advocacy is a glimpse into the
personal drama that lies behind years of legal action and lobbying driven
by parents who persistently challenged established systems. As with other
aspects of the comunity living movement, parents were major players in
the efforts to open schools to children traditionally excluded from
regular classrooms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the 1970s and &#8216;80s, parents of children with a mental handicap began
to develop higher expectations for the lives of their children than had
traditionally been dictated by the medical profession. These parents
wanted alternatives to segregated education and they became involved in
&#8220;early intervention&#8221;, new methods of stimulating their children and
discovering and building on their children&#8217;s capacity to learn. In
following through on their expectations and seeking opportunities for
their sons and daughters, parents were thrust into leadership roles. They
organized parents&#8217; groups, chaired lobbying committees and confronted
school boards and education ministries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The personal perspectives of the contributors demonstrate
not only their courage and conviction in these challenging roles.
They also reveal the extent of their involvement in the politics and
complexities of the education systems as they met with resistance
and worked to understand and untangle a mass of bureaucracy.
It was often the case that they were lobbying for concepts which
people in the education system had not yet begun to consider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The third section</strong>, Innovations and Practical Applications
describes the fruits of these parents&#8217; efforts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;inclusion in action.
As the education system has begun to adapt to demands for inclusion, new
approaches have evolved at all levels. The chapters  in this section are
written by people with first-hand experience in implementing inclusive
programs through the development and pursuit of important strategies for
teachers, school administrators and special education professionals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These strategies cover the many facets of preparation for and planning of
inclusion, such as curriculum development and problem-solving tactics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Readers will notice that authors of the various chapters have used many
different terms to refer to the students targeted in an inclusionary model,
from &#8220;student with a mental handicap&#8221; to &#8220;student with special needs&#8221;
to &#8220;exceptional student&#8221;. These different terms actually reflect the
ongoing struggle with language. In a country as diverse as Canada, people
have conflicting views; what may be acceptable terminology in one area is
seen as backwards and regressive in other areas. Therefore, because the
book reflects the experiences of many people in integration, it also
reflects the state of the evolution of language and that diversity of
opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, many of the contributors to the book mention that they look
forward to a time when the word &#8220;integration&#8221; will not be necessary
because the concept will simply be a fact of life. This view is shared
by people advocating for inclusion who look forward to a day when the
various &#8220;labels&#8221; used to identify people through their differences are
no longer necessary.
David Jory, the parent of a young man labelled mentally handicapped
<a href="#_chapter_5">(see Chapter 5)</a>
writes:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all these years, I do not like to use the word &#8220;integration&#8221; any
more. The use of the word, however, is necessary because, for far too long,
our school systems have practised systematic discrimination against pupils
with a mental handicap. &#8220;Integration&#8221; is simply the process of righting
that wrong. I prefer to think of on integrated schoolsystem in which the
educational needs of all pupils are met appropriately, and I hope that soon
the word &#8220;integrated&#8221; will be unnecessary. But we are not at that stage yet.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book has taken several years to prepare and in the course
of that time we have been anxious to finish it. At the same time
we have been pleased that our contributors have had more
time to update their material based on their continuing
involvement in integrated education initiatives. Most of the
contributors are from New Brunswick and the reasons for this must
be noted. First, since one of the editors is from New Brunswick,
personal knowledge of the people working in this field was a factor.
Second, experience with integrated education as a result of
legislative and policy initiatives is unique in the province,
giving educators and parents substantial experience which they
have shared in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A special word of thanks is due to Dr. G. Michael Fullan, Dean
of the Faculty of Education, University of Toronto, for his
generosity in writing the preface to this book. His words of
support for the approaches put forward are encouraging reinforcement
for people engaged in the struggle towards inclusion. His words
are all the more powerful because he is recognized internationally
as a leader in understanding educational change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to Laura Code, Publications Editor at
The Roeher Institute for her cheerful but persistent prompting
and motivation, without which the book would have never have been
completed. All the contributors deserve recognition both for their
valuable additions to the book as well as for their willingness to
rework their material in order to produce a balance between the
chapters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We hope the strategies and practical suggestions presented in
<em>Changing Canadian Schools</em> will be useful to families and educators
alike. Their efforts will promote the inclusion of people with
disabilities in all aspects of community life, and improve the
education system for all students.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is somewhat ironic that the very organizations that first legitimized
the education of children who have mental handicaps are now the ones
fighting to dismantle the systems that are the product of their success.
Yet, when the Canadian Association for Community Living (CACL) established
a task force to identify issues facing the advocacy movement for people
with mental handicaps, integrated education was rated a top priority
(CACL, 1987). The goal of the Association is to promote the participation
of people with mental handicaps in their communities by focusing on their
citizenship (the power to exercise their rights), their inclusion (as full
members of their communities), and their self-determination (the power to
make their own decisions).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rioux (1988) documents how specialized and separate services result from
a paradigm that labels individuals with intellectual handicaps as socially
inferior. Therefore, the kind of care and treatment available to them,
as well as laws, policies, and programs, have been developed solely on
the basis of this label. Criteria for generic programs systematically keep
out people with mental handicaps and there is a rationalization of the need
for parallel and separate systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the 1980s, the process of gradual, evolutionary
change in special education practice in Canada was subject to
increasing challenge. In this chapter we discuss three factors
[law, advocacy, and educational innovation] which, taken
together, have created in Canada a unique environment supportive
of fundamental change in how students with disabilities are
educated. These developments have resulted in the kind of
ambiguity and inconsistency in special education practice that
has been identified as being necessary for a paradgim shift
(Skrtic, 1987). Whether or not this shift will be toward full
integration of students with disabilities will only become clear
over the next several years. We conclude our review of these
three factors with a brief discussion of the crucial role an
integrated educational program plays in preparing a student
with disabilities for life as an adult in the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_law">LAW</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Special Committee on Social Policy Development of the New
Brunswick Legislature issued its Report on the Review of School
Integration on October 31, 1989. The report was issued following
five weeks of public hearings into school integration, during which
the twelve-member committee visited sixtythree schools and heard
more than 250 briefs presented by parents, members,
administrators, school boards, and other citizens.
The report&#8217;s recommendations in summary include the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The province should confirm its commitment to Bill 85,
which mandated the integration of special needs children
into the regular school system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education minister should clear up differences over
interpretation and implementation of the act and issue &#8220;clear directives
to all school boards.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education minister should immediately give school boards the funds
they need to meet the requirements of the bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More training on teaching exceptional children should be provided to
teachers and &#8230;&#8203; should provide more such training
in their education programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education minister should provide leadership by accenting the
successes and positive points of integration
(Committee reports, 1989).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing controversy over integration and intensive pressure
from the province&#8217;s teachers&#8217; union had prompted the minister of
education in May 1989, to mandate this committee with the task of
reviewing the integration process that has been under way in New
Brunswick since  the passage of Bill 85 in 1986. Union leaders
had maintained that integration was putting New Brunswick&#8217;s already
strained education system at risk of collapse. The president of the New
Brunswick Teachers&#8217; Association claimed that  &#8220;integration is
turning classrooms into zoos&#8221; and creating conditions in which
&#8220;teachers can&#8217;t teach and students can&#8217;t learn&#8221; (Benteau, 1989).
The union insisted that the &#8220;horror stories&#8221; of integration be
made public and that the issue be included in their negotiation
of a new collective agreement (Richardson, 1989). As a result, the
committee&#8217;s strong support for the integration process came as a
surprise to many and as a relief to advocates for students with
disabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While provincial legislation in Canada requires school boards to
provide educational services to students with disabilities, how
the service is delivered is generally left to the discretion of
local school authorities. In Ontario, the passage of Bill 82 in
1980 raised parents&#8217; hopes that integrated programs would be easier to
achieve, but that has not been the result.
Both British Columbia and Alberta have recently revised their
legislation governing schools, but the right of a student
with disabilities to placement in a regular class with his or her
nondisabled peers is not assured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With few exceptions, Canadian school boards have generally offered
options that have become the standard both in this country
(Csapo and Goguen, 1980) and in the United States under public
Law 94-142 (Gartner and Lipsky, 1987):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#8220;pull-out&#8221; resource room programs for students with mild
disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>segregated schools or segregated classes in regular schools
for students with moderate or severe disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individual cases of integration for students with moderate
disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, while education is an area of provincial jurisdiction,
the context in which provincial education legislation operates
underwent a dramatic shift when the Canadian <em>Charter of Rights and
Freedoms</em> was entrenched in the Canadian constitution 1982.
Several sections of the <em>Charter</em> have implications for policy and
practice relevant to the education of students with mental and/or
physical disabilities (McKay, 1984; Vickers and Endicott, 1985). It has
been suggested that the aspects of education legislation which are most
subject to challenge under <em>the Charter</em> are procedures for: student
assessment and categorisation; placement;
the discretion to exclude students from regular classrooms;
and the very concept of segregated education (Robertson, 1987).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Charter</em> created a new environment in which the overriding
principles of liberty, freedom from discrimination, and freedom
of association set broad parameters within which education systems
must operate. Since the equality rights in the <em>Charter</em> did not
come into force until 1985, the assurance of equality rights
in many areas is still in the process of being established.
However, it is the opinion of some that segregated educational
programs are a natural target for litigation based on the <em>Charter</em>
(Donahue, 1988; MacKay, 1987a). In any event, there has been
an increased awareness of and sensitivity to the
question of school integration for students with disabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1986, a Nova Scotia couple, Rick and Maureen Elwood,
obtained a court injunction to keep their son Luke, who had
been labelled mentally handicapped since birth, in a regular
class in their neighbourhood school. They concluded that their
only chance of prevailing in their dispute over his placement
with the Halifax County School Board was to go to trial. School
officials firmly maintained Luke would he better served in a
segregated program. Their position that a range of placement
options was necessary depending on the student&#8217;s level of
disability was consistent with the concept of least restrictive
environment and the
<a href="#_the_holes_in_the_cascade_theory">(Cascade model)</a>
, both typical of traditional
special education practice (Little, 1985). The department of
education did not intervene on their behalf.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Elwoods did not take this action lightly. They knew they
would face the tension and unease of challenging one of the
most established vested authorities in their community, the
educational system. As Jack Batten (1988) explains, they also
knew that inactivity on their part would mean a life of
isolation for their son:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Luke took gym and music classes with normal kids, but,
effectively, he was shut away in a ghetto of disabled
children. And as far as Maureen could make out, he might
pass the rest of his life in different corners of the
same ghetto. He&#8217;d never escape. He&#8217;d never grow. If Luke
was disabled, then the system seemed constructed to keep
him disabled.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dispute went on throughout the 1986-87 school year as the
school board refused to accept the principle of integration.
However, just hours before the case was to open before the
Queen’s Bench division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, the
board initiated discussions that led to a settlement of the
dispute (Batten, 1988). The school board agreed to the parents&#8217;
demand and the result was a court-approved agreement
that assured Luke Elwood an integrated school program with
appropriate support (MacKay, 1987b).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case has received considerable national attention from both parents
and school officials (MacKay, 1987b; McCallum, 1987).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the impetus of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (1982),
a number of parents, parent groups, and educators throughout Canada have
been calling for more integrated and inclusive school programs for
students with disabilities.
In the province of New Brunswick, this led to political action, and,
as indicated above, subsequent legislative reform. Bill 85, which addresses
the equality and procedural issues for educational practise that flow from the Charter,
was unanimously passed by the New Brunswick legislature in 1986.
Section 45(2)1 of Bill 85 (1986) deals with placement considerations and
is particularly significant:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A school board shall place exceptional pupils such that
they receive special education programs and services
in circumstances where exceptional pupils can participate
with pupils who are not exceptional pupils within regular classroom
settings to the extent that is considered practicable by the board having
due regard for the education needs of all pupils.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section provides clear direction that integrated school programs
are assumed to be appropriate for exceptional students in New Brunswick
schools. Alternatives are to be used only after every attempt has been
made to make an integrated program work. A school board may decide that
an integrated program is not practicable for a given student, for a given
period of time, for specific reasons; however, withdrawal is to occur
only for compelling reasons that are considered necessary to meet the
child&#8217;s needs and on the condition that a plan to return the child to
the regular class is made at the time of the withdrawal (Department of
Education, Province of New Brunswick, 1988a).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the law and policy just described for New Brunswick
is clearly the most supportive of integration in Canada, it has
not eliminated legal disputes over placement decisions. At the
same time that teachers in New Brunswick were expressing
grave concern about the effects of integration, one family was
fighting the same battle for their daughter&#8217;s access to a regular
class that the Elwoods had fought two years before in Nova Scotia.
In this case, a legal challenge was made to seek compliance with
a law the parents believed was consistent with the <em>Charter</em>.
Joe and Anne Robichaud had been unhappy for some time with their daughter
Nathalie&#8217;s placement in a special class. As they saw integration
initiated in more and more schools in New Brunswick, they were
increasingly anxious that things should change for her as well. In
the fall off 1987, they arranged for her to attend a regular class but,
when things did not go well, they concluded that school officials
were not willing to do what was necessary to improve the situation,
and they withdrew her from school. Nathalie spent very little time
in school during the 1987-88 school year but the Robichauds declined
repeated suggestions from school administrators that she return to a
segregated class. As the 1988 fall term moved on with Nathalie still
out of school, the Robichauds reluctantly pursued a legal remedy to
their situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Developments in the Robichaud case followed closely the pattern of
the Elwood case. In December 1988, Joe and Anne Robichaud filed suit
against the school board. An injunction was obtained in January 1989
ordering that Nathalie be immediately placed in a regular class until
the case could go to full trial. As a result, Nathalie Robichaud,
like Luke Elwood, attended a regular class while the legal manoeuvring
went on in the background. In June 1989, several weeks after the
Special Committee of Legislators received its mandate to review progress
toward integration, the Robichauds were scheduled to take their case to court.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, counsel for the school board approached the Robichauds about
agreement on a settlement, and, like the Elwoods, the Robichauds were able
to reach agreement only days before their case was to be heard in court.
The settlement provided that Nathalie Robichaud, like Luke Elwood, receive
instruction in a regular classroom in a neighbourhood school with
non-disabled peers. Unfortunately, the Robichauds, like the Elwoods, were
left responsible for their legal expenses while taxpayeres covered the costs
incurred by the school board and their administrators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Robichauds were forced to turn to the courts because New Brunswick&#8217;s
francophone school boards and the francophone division of the department
of education have been perceived as taking a more traditional approach to
integration. The <em>Enoncé de principe sur l&#8217;intégration scolaire</em>, developed
by department officials and issued to school boards, provides for a
&#8220;continuum of service&#8221; based on the Cascade model mentioned above.
It is most often interpreted to mean that a student may be integrated only
when it is clear the student can &#8220;benefit&#8221; from the class. In other words,
the burden of proof rests with the student who must show &#8220;readiness&#8221;
for integration (Department of Education, 1988b).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both the Robichauds and the Elwoods began their legal appeals after the
equality rights provisions of the Canadian <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>
came into effect in 1985. The <em>Charter</em> provided them with a legal basis
for their demands that had not existed previously (Bales vs. Board of
School Trustees, 1984). Since both case were settled out of court, their
resolutions do not have the weight of court decisions. However, the fact
that two different school boards in two provinces capitulated completely
to parent demand at the eleventh hour seems to indicate their expectation
that, faced with the <em>Charter</em>, they would lose in the courtroom. Additional
litigation by parents in the coming decade will be necessary to establish
clear jurisprudence in this contentious area.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_advocacy">ADVOCACY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although many of the segregated schools that existed across
Canada in the early 1980s had been started by local chapters
of the Canadian Association for Community Living (the national
advocacy association for persons with mental handicaps)
segregated schools and segregated classes no longer satisfy
the aspirations of many families. Parent advocacy for integrated
schooling has increased substantially in the years following
adoption of the <em>Charter</em>, particularly by parents of children
labelled mentally handicapped. CACL has advocated and promoted
the right of every student to attend a regular class in a
neighbourhood school. This policy has been formally supported
by all off CACL&#8217;s provincial and territorial affiliates
<a href="/CCS/inclusion/ED308645.pdf">(CACL, 1987)</a>
.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While integation was not a matter of priority to most local
or provincial associations in the early 1980s, at the national
level, The Roeher Institute, sponsored by CACL, began to support
parents as they struggled to articulate their concerns about
their children&#8217;s education. At the community, provincial and
national levels, parents found solidarity and strength by banding
together. As parent demand grew, the (Roeher) Institute and
CACL identified and promoted positive examples of integration
and facilitated training for educators to work in integrated settings.
These courses led to the establishment of university affiliated
programs that are currently providing teachers and school
administrators with the attitudes and skills they need to meet
increasing parent demand for integration. Since the early 1980s,
the (Roeher) Institute and CACL have actively promoted integration
through conferences and seminars, publications, video productions,
and financial and consulting support for selected litigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CACL actively supported the development of an autonomous parent
organization, the Integration Action Group, which now has a
substantial membership in southern Ontario and a number of chapters
in other provinces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the mid 1980s, the Integration Action Group was providing sophisticated
support to individual families struggling to achieve integration. Since
1987, the Centre for Integrated Education (now called the Centre for
Integrated Education and Community) has been another source of training,
consultation, and resource development for both parents and professionals.
Such initiatives are unique to Canada and have helped give parents the
courage and determination to seek integrated educational fittings for
their children. Parents have insisted with considerable success that the
traditional special education system change. The increasing demand from
parents has been evident in every province and territory and the concerns
that have created the demand have been consistent. Parents&#8217; demand for
integrated education stems from a vision for their children&#8217;s future which
they only see realized in a regular class with non-disabled peers.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

<p>Parents have invariably had a deep feeling of malaise both about the

<p>Our experience with special education goes back to 1976. We have seen at
first hand the damage the segregated school system has done to some
students, particularly those with severe handicaps. The system was based
on the negative, stressing the students&#8217; differences and inabilities.
Special education teachers have told us repeatedly that our daughter
Yvonne &#8220;does not understand&#8221;, "`is not able to &#8230;&#8203; `", "`will never be
able to &#8230;&#8203; `", and so on. The turning point came about five years ago with
the recognition that although our daughter will probably always need
assistance in daily living, the most important element in her life will
be friends and the ability to communicate with them. It has taken a
number of years for educators to understand the importance of this.</p>

<h4 id="_innovation">INNOVATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many parts of North America, the expansion of special education has
resulted in the creation of parallel systems for regular and special
education. Many jurisdictions with the most mature and comprehensive
special education services have evolved to the point where the regular
and special education systems exists separately and relate toeach other
only in the most theoretical way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many who promote special education have developed a mentality of
compartmentalizing: rather than restructure a system that is inadequate,
&#8220;gaps in service&#8221; are filled with new special education programs
(Porter, 1990).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal, indeed the mission, of an effective school is to assure success
in learning for all students. The development of a parallel special
education systam has been harmful, not only because it has excluded
exceptional students and prevented their contact with non-disabled peers,
but also because of the effect it has bad on the regular education
program (Gartner and Lipsky, 1987; Reynolds, Wang and Walburg, 1987;
Stainback and Stainback, 1984; Will, 1986).
A School that passes over all the students with learning problems to a
separate special education system undermines its capacity to be a
holistic unit that serves all students well. The Director of education
of a Roman Catholic school board in western Canada describes his
rationale for dismantling such a separate structure:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1982 &#8230;&#8203; I took the Student Services Department out of the
organizational chart and said were will be one department, and it will
be Instructional Services. Until than there were two heads of two
departments. I said if Student Services is part of Instuction then it
has to be part of that department, right at the board level too. We
didn&#8217;t wipe out the staff, but we [incorporated] Student Services [into]
Instructional Services&#8230;&#8203; People [often] want to keep the functions
separate. My contention is that organizationally we&#8217;ve got to have them
together. If there&#8217;s a sense of education being integral and being for
everybody, then those services have to be in the one department.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Porter<br>
<cite>1990)</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is now recognized that learning problems are contextual. They exist
within the context of the classroom where the curriculum design and the
instructional strategies employed by the teacher influence the degree to
which exceptional students can be effectively served. A commitment to
integrated or inclusive education means teachers, schools, and the
community commit themselves to resolving problems that arise in a way
that respects the integrity of the school as an organization (Porter, 1986).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traditional approach to special education encouraged the classroom
teacher to refer any difficulties to experts who would diagnose,
prescribe, and invariably provide alternate instruction for the student
(Little, 1985). The message inherent was that regular class teachers
were not qualified or competent to provide education to a student with a
significant learning problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The past decade has seen an increasing number of school districts make a
commitment to full integration for all students
(Forest, 1984a; Forest, 1987).
These range from several Catholic school districts in southern Ontario
(Little, 1985), to French-language districts in Quebec (Frigon, 1988),
to several public districts in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British
Columbia (Porter, 1990). Many other school districts across Canada are
moving toward more integrated approaches to special education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the compelling features of the school districts that have moved
toward an integrated approach on a systemic basis is what Sage (1989)
has described as the relatively &#8220;primitive&#8221; level of development of
their special services when they began to incorporate integration policy
and practice. The term &#8220;primitive&#8221; is not used in a negative sense,
but rather to draw attention to the districts&#8217; relatively late
development of special education programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is true of many small and rural school districts in Canada as well as many of the separate or Roman Catholic school systems,
where the neighbourhood school may he the only school available. Developing support for integration in such circumstances can
be based on the natural sensitivity of a local school to the families that live in the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Administrators from a small school district in New Brunswick illustrated this point well in their presentation to the province&#8217;s
legislative committee. District 21 is made up of several small towns and islands along the southwest coast of New Brunswick.
It has 1,550 students in eight community schools. The superintendent
describes his school board’s close relationsip with the public:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are not at arm’s length, but shoulder to shoulder with the public, [who] are involved in their community school.
[T]hey were involved with the integration process before and after 1987,
and they feel reasonably comfortable with it.</p>

<cite>1989</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The separate or Roman Catholic school boards in several provinces also have features that have made them more
receptive to integration. First, the traditional segregated special education programs have been linked to the public
school system. Therefore, the segregated schools and segregated classes so characteristic of the last several decades
passed them by (Forest, 1983; Forest, 1984a). A second and equally important factor is the stress Roman Catholic school
systems have placed on the importance of values and the nurturing of family, church, and community through the
school (Flynn and Kowalczyk-McPhee, 1989; Hanson, 1987):</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is critical and essential in the Catholic School System [is] the
sense of community that reaches out and accepts everbody; not just the
football or basketball player, but [also] this youngster who had to be
pushed in a wheelchair; who had to be taken to the toilet; [a sense of
community that sees] his sense of humour [despite] his disability [and]
pain &#8230;&#8203; He was the one giving support to the others at times &#8230;&#8203; I can
talk about [integrtion] from an educatinal, philosopic point of view. I
can [also] talk about it from a religious point of view and the two move
hand in hand.</p>

<p>A similar view is expressed by Dr. Albert Murray, district superintendent
of school districts 28 and 29 in New Brunswick, which have been using an
integration approach for students with disabilities since 1985 (Porter, 1986):</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Children with special needs must not be viewed just from the perspective of their disability. They must not be simply
assessed, assigned a category, and given the most specialized treatment possible. Rather, they must be viewed holistically
as belonging to a valued and supportive community, which, for young people, is the peer group found in the classroom.
The need is to adjust the classroom organization, instructional strategies, and curriculum to meet the challenges of the wide
range of learners. This is good educational practice [that] assists all students in realizing their highest potential as
individuals and as members of society. Such an approach permits schools to do what they were intended to do, [enabling]
students to learn and belong, and &#8230;&#8203; teachers to facilitate the process.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other examples of innovation grew out of situations in which the traditional system was firmly entrenched and the only avenue
leading to integration was to start an alternative program or school. The Saturday-Get-Together, Summer-Get-Together and
Thousand Cranes School are among alternative examples of how integration could produce positive results
for children (Bracewell and Milligan, 1984; Forest, 1981; Forest, 1982).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While such innovation has been difficult in large school systems, isolated examples have flourished in virtually every province
and territory, and networking among like-minded educators has helped to promote and refine the models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>School districts that have been willing to take alternative challenge and develop innovative and supportive alternatives
to the old models of segregated special education have been critical to the progress made in Canada. We believe this movement
will continue to grow as more and more jurisdictions break through  traditional barriers and forge an even stronger basis not
only for integration, but for the education of all students. As one teacher involved in integrated school programs explains it:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the biggest thing we&#8217;ve done, other than Integration is to make teachers aware of the fact that all children are not
learning at the grade level. They have to teach them at the level they&#8217;re at and have them meet with success at thatlevel.
Ithink [this is ] happening a lot more than it ever happened before &#8230;&#8203; A lot of children are having their needs met [today,
wheras] before [they] would have just been pushed along or ignored.</p>

<h4 id="_conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we have described the movement toward schools that accept and include all students in regular classrooms.
We have identified factors related to law, advocacy, an educational innovation as being critical to this development.
Yet it is also true that despite the positive changes made in Canada in the last decade most children with serious disabilities
still spend most of their time in segregated classes with little opportunity to interact with their non-disabled peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Biklen (1985) has identified quality education as respectful of the individual needs of all students, creative, exciting, and
welcomming of children regardless of their differences. Not only does integated education prepare children with handicapping
conditions to become part of their communities, it also prepares the children without any identifiable handicap to do the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A parent who was impressed with the way the children in her daughter&#8217;s integrated Grade 1 class welcomed, cared for, and felt
responsible for a student with Down Syndrome gives us a view of a very different future. She describes  what her non-handicapped
child has learned from being educated in an integrated setting:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our Erin now has a good under standing of what Down Syndrome means and
understands also that this child can progress. She is comfortable with
[handicapped people] and realistic and positive about them. It is a joy
to us, as parents, in this highly competitive world, to see that these
values can and do exist, and can be lived within an often less-than-perfect
school system.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a sense the jury is still out, not on whether integration is a good idea, but on how the movement toward inclusionary
education will proceed in Canada. The challenge to school systems is a major one as the experience in New Brunswick illustrates.
This creates a situation where those involved in education need to decide whether the prevailing approach to special education
should he defended and enhanced, or whether fundamental and innovative changes should be implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In both the Elwood and Robichaud cases the school authorities and the professionals
involved resisted the parents&#8217; demands and
hardened their positions. In both cases this was harmful to the parents and the child, as well as the school system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our view, a more positive and constructive approach is in the interest
of concerned. The essential elements of this approach are the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The support the <em>Charter</em> offers for integated education should he
acknowleded and school authorites should initiate programs to develop and
implement such programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School authorities and professionals must work to develop real partnership
with parents, drawing on their visions for their children&#8217;s future, as
well as including them in meaningful way in actual program planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professionals engaged directly or indirectly in public education, such
as teachers, psychologists, social workers, and therapists need to develop
strategies for more effectiv collaboration to support a more inclusionary
educational program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The opportunity to enhance the natural capacity of our communities to
support individuals with disabilities through integrated school programs
is clear. We conclude with the words of a parent who articulated her
support for a new approach to schooling to the New Brunswick legislative
committee:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I went to a school &#8230;&#8203; that was not integrated. I was an adult when I had
my first encounter with on integrated person, and it happened to be my
own child. I think my idea of society was incorrect because I was not
allowed to have that experience &#8230;&#8203; I cannot see how there is a negative
aspect to learning something new, getting rid of a prejudice, learning
how to get along with someone who is different, whether mentally,
physically, or racially. I think that it is only positive.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Diane Richler</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pressure to provide education for children with mental handicaps began a half century ago when concerned parents banded
together because they wanted their children with mental handicaps to remain at home, to be educated in the community and to be
kept out of institutions. From the creation of special educational classes for a few children grew a vision of inclusion for
all individuals who have been called mentally handicapped, in all aspects of community life. This vision included full
participation in regular classes in neighbourhood schools. That effort has converged, both in its goals and in its vision of
the rights of all people, with two broader societal trends. One is the movement towards the equality of all citizens, which is
creating awareness of a new Canadian society — one that embraces diversity in all aspects of life. The other is the trend for
educational reform which is causing both the public-at-large and educators to reformulate the educational system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_selective_diversity">SELECTIVE DIVERSITY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Canada is by definition a nation of diversity. The aboriginal people of this vast country represent but a fraction of the mosaic
of races, cultures, religions, languages and lifestyles that is increasingly evident in Canadian cities, towns and villages.
Outdated views of Canadians as descendants of white Europeans who speak either English or French have been challenged. There is
formal recognition that members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police need not be tall white men in the traditional wide-rimmed
hat. They might also be men of colour in turbans, or even women. The legal protection of this new reality has been accompanied
(often painfully slowly!) by a shift in attitude and public perception.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet, while Canada evolves into a country where diversity of cultural background is welcomed and celebrated, other distinctions,
particularly disability, still set some people apart. These people continue to be met by insurmountable barriers, caused by
other&#8217;s attitudes, and by legislation, and societal policies and programs. They ultimately face systematic discrimination and
exclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of all disabilities, intellectual disability is the most negatively perceived, leaving persons who have a mental handicap to live
with comprehensive discrimination and exclusion. <strong>Last in the Queue</strong> (Rioux, 1989) documents the layers of this exclusion. These
layers must be systematically peeled back in order for persons who have an intellectual disability to take their place as
citizens and participants in the full sense of community life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For persons who have a mental handicap and their families, the barriers to the community are often extremely destructive. They
deprive people of self-actualisation, economic independence, intimacy in relationship, mental and physical health, and the
ability to chart the course of their own lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recent studies indicate that there are at least 15,000 persons in Canada living in institutions because they have been
identified as having a mental handicap (Richler, 1991).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Canadian Association for Community Living estimates that there are at
least an equal number of people living in nursing homes, chronic care
hospitals and private institutions. In addition, a 1991 study conducted
by CACL reports that there are over 114,000 children and youths in segregated
education programs, the vast majority of whom have a mental handicap.
Furthermore, tens of thousands of working-age adults who have a mental
handicap are excluded from competitive employment. Instead, they attend
sheltered workshops or job-readiness programs or are excluded from any
activity day after day (CACL, 1991).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_struggle_for_inclusion">THE STRUGGLE FOR INCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as other minority groups in Canada have struggled for inclusion in
the mainstream of society, so people who have a mental handicap, their
families and their friends have engaged in a long campaign for inclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first organized activities began simultaneously around the world
immediately after the Second World War. Learning from the rehabilitation
services which assisted disabled veterans, parents of sons and daughters
who had a mental handicap came together to develop rehabilitation services
in the community. These services were their alternative to placing their
children in large, custodial institutions. The parent groups evolved into
associations which took the lead in creating opportunities for their sons
and daughters with mental handicaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because their children were denied entry to public schools, the first
priority of the associations was usually to begin a class, and then
eventually a school in which to teach them. The teachers were often
volunteers, or, if paid, were not professional educators because the
teaching profession had not yet accepted that children who had been labelled
&#8220;retarded&#8221; could learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually, these classes and schools became a part of the public
education system and a new profession of &#8220;special educators&#8221; emerged
to operate them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the development of education programs in the 1950s and 1960s, most
community service associations moved on to establish group homes and
sheltered workshops. In the 1970s and 1980s, services prolierated at the
local level across Canada. In addition to the establishment of education,
residential and vocational programs, there were explosions in the areas
of recreation, family support, and early intervention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of most services was to support individuals with a mental
handicap to live in the community rather than in institutions.
However, while the new services were physically &#8220;in&#8221; the community,
they operated as independent entities with no links to the parallel
generic services for the community at large.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the parents&#8217; movement can be credited with the birth of special
education for students with an intellectual disability, by the 1980s it
appeared their vision had outgrown their initial achievements. It had
been necessary to institute an intermediate system of programs to
overcome total exclusion; however, programmed childhood was leading to
programmed adulthood. The special education system, which had been
developed to prepare children to be part of their communities and to
eliminate the need for institutionalization, was in fact preparing people
for lives of isolation. They were moving into group homes, working in
sheltered workshops and still being marginalized from the rest of the
community. By the mid 1980s, there was a pervasive dissatisfaction with
the segregated service system in the community. It was time to move
onward and upward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The national voluntary organization, begun by parents at the local level
in the late 1940s, had been incorporated at the national level in 1958.
It had expanded to include not only parents and other family members, but
professionals working in the field, other interested citizens and, most
recently, persons who themselves had been considered mentally handicapped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, because of the inclusion of self-advocates the association
changed its name in 1985 from the Canadian Association for the Mentally
Retarded to the Canadian Association for Community Living.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immediately after the change of name, the association embarked on an
eighteen-month review of its goals and objectives. After consulting with
its membership in ten provincial, two territorial and over four hundred
local associations, the organization developed a plan entitled
<strong>Community Living 2000</strong> which described a vision for the year 2000. The
vision is of individuals supported by a network of family and friends;
they have opportunities to attend regular neighbourhood schools and be
included in regular classrooms; they have meaningful work and control
over the tax dollars being spent on their behalf; they have opportunities
to develop a personal lifestyle and receive reliable support when they
need it. This vision is shared by self-advocates, families, and members
of the association-at-large. The vision is anchored in several principles
which the association identified as critical in order to achieve true and
full participation in their communities by all individuals, regardless of
handicap. They are citizenship, membership and self-determination.
Citizenship is the actualization of rights without discrimination. It
encompasses voting, having equal opportunities for employment, and being
entitled to due process of law whether as a victim, a witness or an
accused. Membership is a sense of belonging: having friends and families
through good times and bad. Self-determination is the ability to chart the
course of one&#8217;s life: to choose with whom and where to live; to have a
choice of career; and to choose the individuals who are providing support
for activities in daily life.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_new_social_agenda">A NEW SOCIAL AGENDA</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Education in the regular school system is one of the fundamental elements upon which participation in the community is built.
Advocates tor individuals with a mental handicap first began to promote the idea of integrated education in the early 1970s,
and the first attempts at &#8220;planned integration&#8221; began at that time. However, the people calling for inclusion of all students
in the regular school system were few and far between. Examples of successes were even more scarce, and little effort was made
within establishd forums to seriously address the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As bleak as the prospects were twenty years ago, the early 1990s have seen visitors from around the world look to Canada for
models of inclusion. In Canada, integration in education is now a priority of the national advocacy organization; independent
advocacy organizations have begun to promote integration primarily and it has become a preoccupation of school boards,
departments and faculties of education and a regular subject in the media. What happened in the years since 1970 to push
integated education onto the social policy agenda?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It appears that several factors have converged to create a climate in which support for inclusive education has flourished.
These factors include developments in the advocacy movement of and for persons who have a mental handicap, the broadening human
rights perspective in Canada, and educational reform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the advocacy movement of and for persons who have a mental handicap, the adoption of the <strong>Community Living 2000</strong> plan has
helped mobilized efforts to include all students with mental handicaps in regular education. The analysis which produced that
plan was greatly influenced by the principle of normalization, which gained recognition in the 1970s and 1980s. Originally
conceptualized by Bank-Mikelson and Nirje in Scandinavia in the late 1960s and expanded by Wolfensberger in North
America in the 1970s, the principle challenged the traditional segregation of persons with a mental handicap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wolf Wolfensberger spent two years at The Roeher Institute (then known as the National Institute on Mental Retardation) as a
visiting scholar, and the Canadian Association for Community Living (then the Canadian Association for the Mentally Retarded)
invested heavily in promoting the concept of normalization through training and publications. As the concept gained acceptance,
advocates and service providers alike began to look at emerging community programs and to question how services might be
organized differently to include previously devalued individuals in the mainstream of their communities. While the principle of normalization prompted a healthy re-evaluation of community services, as the 1980s progressed it became clear that simply improving segregated services would not provide the tools for eliminating the barriers to inclusion in the mainstream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concurrent with the emerging experiences rooted in normalization, activists promoting changes for persons with a mental handicap
were influenced by an increased awareness in Canada of human rights. In 1981, Canada repatriated its constitution and included
in it a <strong>Charter of Rights and freedoms</strong>. The original <strong>Charter</strong> prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, national or
ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex or age. A 1985 amendment also prohibited discrimination on the basis of mental or physical
disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Protection by the <strong>Charter</strong> provided individuals, families and advocacy organizations with a weapon to use in gaining access to
generic services. It also helped people to recognize citizenship rights, which enabled them to be more demanding of services.
People no longer had to depend on charity or voluntary goodwill, but could make certain demands on the basis of their
citizenship. The <strong>Charter</strong> influenced both how individuals who had been labelled mentally handicapped saw themselves and how
they were perceived by others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For many people the overriding image of individuals with intellectual disabilities had been as consumers of services.
Their regnition in the <strong>Charter</strong> changed the image to one of citizenship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While people within the advocacy movement were expanding their vision of posibilities, influenced by human rights advances and
normalization concepts, the field of education was also undergoing major changes. There was a recognition of experiential
learning - that children learn by doing, not by sitting in straight rows listening to a teacher. There was a growing
appreciation of different learning styles, of individualized approaches to teaching. Experiments in creating open spaces and
regrouping children were carried out. These changes made classrooms more easily adaptable to children  who were previously
outside the narrow definition of &#8220;average&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, early demonstrations of integration occurred in settings which were designed to meet the individual needs of a wide
range of students using alternative educational models (Forest, 1984 and 1987). These early programs exceeded the expectations
of the advocates for children with intellectual disabilities. Their success demonstrated not only that disabled students could
be educated beside their non-disabled peers, but that in the process all the children benefitted and the overall quality of the
education improved!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_new_coalitions">NEW COALITIONS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The convergence of the normalization and human rights experiences with the fresh approach to teaching methods created a new
environment and new alliances. Previously, many advocates for persons who had been labelled mentally handicapped had identified
allies only within their existing networks. Parents and other volunteers had collaborated with progressive service providers to
improve services and increase the participation of people with a mental handicap in the mainstream of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the field of education, those progressive service providers were special education teachers and administrators who worked
outside of the regular education system. In the 1980s, for the first time, educators within the regular system who had been
exposed to advocacy could make the connection between integration and their own objectives to improve the quality of education
overall. The focus of the advocacy movement slowly shifted from a partnership with special educators to a partnership with
general educators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, the human rights movement was quick to ally itself with those seeking equality for persons with a mental handicap.
The growing movement for human rights drew its early leadership from the women&#8217;s movement and from vigorous advocacy for persons
with a physical disability. Its members saw the relationship between these groups&#8217; experiences of discrimination and those of
people who had been called mentally handicapped. These linkages were represented by the growing number of self-advocates who
increasingly assumed leadership roles in both the human rights and mental handicap movements.
Therefore, the struggle in the 1940s, &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s undertaken by a small single-interest group to secure education for labelled
children became the cause of a new, loosely organized coalition. It now included people who had long been advocating for
individuals with a mental handicap, and leaders from the human rights movement and from the field of education.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_keystone_to_community_living">THE KEYSTONE TO COMMUNITY LIVING</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The social policy agenda developed by the Canadian Association for Community Living and promoted under the name <strong>Community
Living 2000</strong>, seeks to achieve citizenship, membership and self-determination for all people who have a mental handicap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inclusion in regular education is a keystone of that social policy agenda, particularly in order to achieve the goals of
citizenship and membership.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For many individuals, the label &#8220;mental handicap&#8221; was applied when they enter the school system. Once in a segregated school
system, most students were guaranteed a future of continued segregation. Graduation from the sepegated school meant entering a
sheltered workshop and often moving into a group home. Few would ever have the opportunity to move on from a sheltered workshop
into a job in the workforce, and people living in group homes see them as another institution (Park, 1991).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Participation in the regular classroom gives students who have a disability the opportunity to escape the cycle of segregation.
They break the cycle in three ways: they acquire skills which make their participation more meaningful; they develop
relationships which foster true membership in the community; and their presence teaches other people how to accommodate the
surrounding environment to their differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of participation in an integrated setting is that learning takes place in an environment which
provides its own rewards and measures of success. Parents and teachers from across Canada consistently report that students who
move from segregated to integrated systems demonstrate improvements in communications skills, concentration skills and demeanour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers report that non-disabled students are often the most creative in helping to accommodate the needs of a peer who has a
disability. Children are able to communicate without words, see wheelchairs as toys, perceive challenges as games.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The citizenship of students who have a mental handicap is already being enhanced through the elimination of segregation.
As a part of their education, students with disabilities are learning about their rights and responsibilities as citizens,
and their non-disabled classmates are learning not to discriminate on the basis of disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, the relationships formed between the student who has a disability and his or her peers can last a lifetime and the
benefits will touch both lives. In the past, most non-disabled students never had opportunities to meet an individual with a
mental handicap. Therefore, many adults are unsure about how to react to individuals with a disability they meet as neighbours,
clients, patients, customers, colleagues or co-participants in leisure activities. When the generation of students now in
integated classes grows up, our communities should be transformed. The children who are helping to solve the challenges of
accommodation in the classroom will be the adults who will make accommodation possible in the workplace and who will expect
their communities to include their former classmates. Non-disabled adults often turn to relationships formed during their school
years to assist in finding a job or a place to live or simply for friendship. And so students who have a mental handicap and who
have experienced integrated education will also have a network of relationships, and a community of peers who understand how to
accommodate their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Already there are many stories about individuals who have a disability who have grown up as part of their communities and are
benefitting from the friendships they formed. One story involves a young doctor who was able to respond to the needs of a patient
at the scene of an emergency because he had grown up on the same street as her and knew how to respond to her. Other doctors and
nurses had reacted nervously to the woman (Schaefer, 1982). Another story involves a person who has been labelled mentally
handicapped and who is the business partner of two former classmates, one a doctor and the other an accountant.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_impact_of_integration">THE IMPACT OF INTEGRATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the concept of integration in education was gaining momentum in the early 1980s it had few supporters. Now, however, there
is a critical mass of people representing different interests working tomake integration a reality for all students, regardless
of disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As many of the chapters in this book indicate, integration works when there is a careful analysis of the needs of the student
with the disability. It usually requires close collaboration among professionals, involvement of parents, activity-based learning,
a child-centred focus, and an emphasis on pluralism and cooperation rather than competition. These factors improve the system for
all students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the broader vision of a more inclusive society, integration in education makes <strong>Community Living 2000</strong> a possibility.
If all school-aged children are taught by example that people who have a disability are equal members of our communities, there
will be less risk of exclusion later in life. Parents will be better prepared to deal with the challenges of having a child who
has a disability. Adults who have a disability will be better prepared for the workforce and coworkers will be better prepared
to acommodate them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Opportunities will increase for people who have a disability to be supported to live in their own homes rather than group homes.
The number of segregated programs such as sheltered workshops and group living arrangements should dramatically decrease.
While some of these changes are beginning as the transition to inclusive education continues, the rate of change is hampered
by existing systemic discrimination as well as by inexperience on the part of community opinion-leaders. These leaders need
direction as to the role they can play in promoting community living for all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Experience in the classroom with students who have a disability will assist the opinion-leaders of tomorrow in
defining their role in the movement to bring about social changes and achieve full inclusion.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When myths masquerade as reality, fact and fiction become inseparable.
It becomes difficult for most people to know what to believe and what not
to believe. In addition, any serious analysis of problems becomes
confusing, at best. This is the position we find ourselves in when we
look at the issue of integrated education for children with mental
handicaps. We have been led to believe in certain so called &#8220;truths&#8221;
about education in Canada. Because these have been presented as facts,
they are often used to obscure or discredit any serious discussion or
argument for integration in our public school system. In making a clear
and convincing case for education integration, the fallacy of these
&#8220;facts&#8221; must be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Popular debate over integrating children with mental handicaps into the
school system has been frequently couched in terms of four myths. The
first is that education is universal, that it is available to every
child in Canada without restriction. The second is that the available
education is equitable and equal for each child in the school system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third presumption is that the education system is structured and run
in a way that is necessary for the continuation of the current economic
and social systems. The final myth is that the structure of the education
system results in a social and economic system that ensures equality
based on ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These four assumptions tend to be framed both as prescriptive and
descriptive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in other words they both ought to be the case and they
are the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people who work in and influence the education system act upon the
assumptions as though they are fact. They will argue that integration is
either unnecessary or damaging to the education system&#8217;s accomplishments.
Any person who challenges the educational system by attempting to
integrate children with mental hancaps will encounter the resistance of
these teachers and administrators. It is important to understand their
position based on these assumptions and to decide the soundness of this
position.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_myth_of_universality_in_education">The Myth of Universality in Education</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first assumption is that education in Canada is universal; in other
words, that everyone has access to it. Universal and free education has
been held as both a right and a necessity in a democratic society. It is
a right because, in Canada, we believe that people should be able to read
and write and to have equal opportunity in life. It is considered
necessary that education be universal because it is assumed that people
learn a basic set of social values in school. Education is considered so
important that it has been made compulsory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What realities challenge the universal education myth? The reality is
that there has never been a truly universal education system in Canada.
Historically, many people have been excluded from the mainstream
education system. While most of those people are now provided with some
form of education, the quality is inconsistent. And there still exists
an entire class of people who have no access to the regular school
system: mainly children who have been labelled mentally handicapped,
disabled or emotionally or behaviourally disturbed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Children one screened out of the education system by being divided into two categoris: those who can be educated and those who
cannot be educated. Those who are labelled uneducable are than no longer considered the responsibility of the neighbourhood
school. The classifications&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;educable and uneducable&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are accepted because they are said to be based on objective and value-free
criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is these classifications are founded on a knowledge base which presumes that the criteria determining whether a
person is &#8220;educable&#8221; are inherent in the potential student. With this presumption, other conditions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as the way the
education system is structured or the way it operates — are not taken into consideration. There is no investigation into how
structural or operational conditions affect a child&#8217;s ability to benefit from angular education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people have been convinced that scientific criteria ensure objectivity and, therefore, it is acceptable to create
legislation based on such criteria. The political and social consequences of deciding that someone is uneducable are seldom
taken into account or questioned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_myth_of_equitable_education">The Myth of Equitable Education</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second myth is that education is equitable. Not only is it presumed that all children have access to the public
educationsystem but it is presumed that they all receive a similar or equal education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Universal access to education is thought to include the notion of an equivalent and impartial quality of learning. This means it
doesn&#8217;t matter who the child is or where the child goes to school, what the child learns will be up to an accepted standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a person has access to education, which is said to be available for
all, it then follows that the student&#8217;s personal ability is reflected in
how well the student does at school. If the student does well it is
assumed that he or she should be rewarded both in school and in the
opportunities he or she has based on his or her performance at school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What realities challenge the myth that education is equitable? It has been
shown over and over again that the quality of education varies significantly
from one school to another, and evan within each school In most cases the
quality depends on how closly a child approximates the ideal student on
which the school curriculum and pedagogical methods are structured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Curriculum is usually based on the prsumption that the child&#8217;s intellectual
&#8220;raw matter&#8221;, outlined in popular taxonomies, is more or less the same
for all students and, therefore, equally shared by all students. This
presumption forms, to a large extent, the distinguishing features of the
&#8220;ideal&#8221; student who is targeted by the education system through the
curriculum content and pedagogical methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In cultivating these intellectual properties, the purpose of the education
system is to bring the &#8220;ideal&#8221; student, latent in every child, from the
potential to the actual state. This is like assuming that every kernel of
corn starts off with the same potential to be a perfect piece of popcorn.
Of course, this is a circular argument based on the false presumption that
natur distributes intellectual raw matter in an equitable manner in the
first place. But, as we know, not every kernel of corn has the same potential
to pop, for many reasons. Even if all kernel are subjected to the same
conditions of heat, oil and distribution in the pot, they will not
necessarily pop in an identical manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The self-fulfilling prophesy inherent in this process should not be overlooked.
When it is argued that a supposedly fair spectrum
of qualities will be targeted in education, and when students rise to those
expectations, there is an illusion that people are being educated properly
and that people who fail are legitimately failures. The structure of the
process makes it difficult to ask whether the narrow spectrum of intellectual
properties targeted are the entire range properties on which education
ought to focus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adapting to the school system is another key part of the educational experience. Even if a student closely fits the model for
whom the system has been designed, there is no guarantee that she or he will succeed by traditional standards, such as grades.
This is because the skills of teachers as educators vary to a large degree. The more homogeneous the students and the more the
teacher is like the students, in class and culture, the more likely a student is to achieve high grades within the public
education system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_myth_of_meritocracy">The Myth of Meritocracy</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third general assumption about the school system is that the rationale behind the operation of public education is necessary
for the social and economic system to continue. The argument is that the school system in its present form prepares people for a
social structure that is dependent on a certain form of social order. The public school system is important as an objective,
dispassionate, impartial, rational mechanism for 1) ensuring that children learn, and 2) differentiating the abilities of
students to determine who will have some to higher education, credentials, and jobs. The school system is set up as the basis
of the meritocracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The assumption of meritocracy is that people are not equal in their talents and abilities nor are their strengths of equal
importance. Meritocracy has been justified because it has been presumed that social and economic efficiency and progress are
necessary. These are dependent on identifying and rewarding people whose natural gifts sustain the welfare, culture and progress
of society. Education is the medium for meritocracy.
Inequality is, according to these assumptions, not only justifiable, but necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are dangerous assumptions. There is no necessity for the education system to operate as it now does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, figures show that enormous numbers of Canadians are illiterate despite having been to school; this suggests that the
system is not even capable of reaching goals much more limited than those itpromises to reach. Since the system,as it functions
at present, does not ensure social progress and efficiency, there is little argument for its continuation in its present form.
Neither the exclusion of people with mental handicaps from neighbourhood schools, nor the assumption that individual capacity
determines how well a student performs lead to the promised efficiency and social order.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_ability_equals_equality">Ability Equals Equality</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fourth myth follows from the acceptance of the third. In this case, people have been convinced that the existing education
system ensures equality because it is based on the objective criteria of ability. A notion of equality founded on a belief in
meritocracy is based not on some set of human characteristics or human attributes but on a certain narrowly defined and
measurable set of abilities that contribute to the present social and economic order. In this way it is argued that the economic
and social distributions in society are a reflection of biological capacity. In other words, it is fair that some people have
more and some people have less in society because it simply reflects what they contribute to society. Therefore, political
inequality can be attributed to biological characteristics that are reflected in intellectual ability which is determined during
the education process. A person is equal to others to the extent that she or he has the ability to compete in spheres deemed to
be important to social and economic progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reality, as opposed to the myth, is that the education system is not structured, as it claims, to provide people with an
education, or even to equalize their opportunities and strengthen their abilities. Instead, it is structured to provide a
justifiable, formal means of filtering out people who will then be denied all social benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, on the other hand, there was a will to create a school system in which
children truly had equal opportunities, the new system would have to look
very different from the one now in place.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_real_message_of_the_education_system">THE REAL MESSAGE OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What then is the real message of an education system which is designed to
value things that persons with mental handicaps cannot do, and which then
claim them uneducable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inherent in its attitude is a presumption about theincamcities of persons
with mental handicaps. In addition, there is an implied expectation that
persons with a mental handicap will not be in regular public schools or
participants in the community in general. It is not surprising that the
person with a mental handicap has problems functioning in an environment
based on these assumptions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an environment created with no consideration
of their abilities or participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the heyday of social darwinism and the eugenics movement, education
became the basis of qualification for entrance into elites, and the school
system became the certifying agency. Science thought it had found a way
to quantify and measure people&#8217;s intelligence. Science seemed to provide
objective criteria which justified selective participation, entitlement
and rights&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which, in fact, legitimized a system of dismimination. A
rationale was created for particular distinctions and labels, which
could have a medical and professional basis rather than a social basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now know that science is unable to completely quantify intelligence.
However, standardized testing and narrow curriculum persist in disentitling
some people and restricting their opportunities to participate. Gould, in
his classic work <strong>The Mismeasure of Man</strong> (1981), claims that we continue
to assign to intelligence a whole set of complex human capabilities that
support "` &#8230;&#8203; the [recognition of] the importance of mentality in our lives
and wish to characterize it, in part so that we can make the divisions
and distinctions among people that our cultural and political systems dictate.`"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original IQ tests, developed by Binet in 1904, had the express and
limited purpose "` &#8230;&#8203; of identifying children whose poor performance
indicated a need for special education &#8230;&#8203; And the aim of his scale was
to identify in order to help and improve, not to label in order to limit`"
(Gould, 1981).
Binet presumed that intelligence could be augmented by education designed to cater
to the specific needs of the child. His three principles for using his tests were:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The scores are a practical devise; they do not buttress any theory of
intellect. They do not define anything innate or permanent. We may not
designate what they measure as &#8220;intelligence&#8221; or any other reified entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scale is a rough, empirical guide for identifying mildly retarded
and learning-disabled children who need special help. It is not a device
for ranking normal children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever the cause of dificulty in children identified for help, emphasis
shall be placed upon improvment through special training. Low scores shall
not be used to mark children as innately incapable. (Gould, 1981)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These principles were disregarded as the use of IQ and other standardized
testing became popular over the next eighty years. Since Binet&#8217;s time, IQ
and other standardized testing has been used to exclude children from
regular classes, to place them in restricted environments, to deny them
jobs, to sterilize them, to prevent their immigation, and to place many
other restrictions on their social and economic participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legitimizing the value of intelligence (and education&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an achieved rather
than an ascribed characteristic) has made it possible to attach notions
of merit to social order. Meritocracy is simply a process by which society
gives out its rewards to those who have merit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The critical question is: who or what is worthy of merit?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merit eliminates the need for measures that enable or ensure equality
because it is based on an acknowledgment and acceptance of the
&#8220;aristocracy of merit&#8221;. That means there are a few people who, because
of their superior intellectual qualities and their efforts, are born to
be leaders. It is assumed that there is a natural order where the welfare,
culture and progress of society depend on an aristocracy of these
intellectually skilled. The argument continues that social efficiency and
progress depend on rule by the elite of merit. Further, meritocratic rule
must be implemented with supremacy over all other social values:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The meritocatic assumption that efficiency (and civilization) depends on
inequality means that it is more important that human affairs be in the
hands of an energetic, capable, skilled elite than that every person has
an equal chance to rise in its ranks.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The school system has become the vehicle for sorting people this way. It
is less and less a place for educating people in the most important sense.
Because most people with mental handicaps are judged to have few natural
(innate) cognitive skills, they are simply denied, by definition, any
access to the meritocracy, to the rewards of society. The characteristics
they possess are not relevant or valued according to the standards of the
meritocracy. Effort without intelligence does not provide access to the
rewards of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over-valuation of certain forms of intelligence and experience has become
entrenched and reinforced through the public education system. This can
be seen in how the school system awards excellence in certain disciplines
and ignores competence in others. At its simplest level, the sciences are
much more relevant than the arts within the formal school system. At a
more complex level, the individual achievement of a person with a mental
handicap in accomplishing certain skills is often viewed as irrelevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is because of a persisting utilitarian philosophy which assumes the
greatest good for the greatest number of people is achieved when educators
target students with the maximum potential for contributing to the
maintenance of the social and economic order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equality is sacrificed in the face of expidiency and efficiency.
Fundamental values and the contributions from people with different
intellectual abilities are of no value within that framework. Therefore
education, like other institutions in late twentieth century society, has
become a political activity.</p>

<h4 id="_the_need_for_restructuring">THE NEED FOR RESTRUCTURING</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Educators, students, administrators are caught up in this predicament.
It is still impossible to make square blocks fit into round holes.
Education integration is now little more than a process of putting
students with disabilities in classrooms where the structure ensures
failure for the majority of them, creating the dilemma that both
participating and not participating are disadvantageous. There is an
entire body of literature concerned with theories of education and special
education; all these works begin with premises that are counterproductive
to achieving real equality in the education system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The education system has, ultimately, helped &#8220;educate&#8221; society into a
form of blindness about how people with mental handicaps enrich and
enhance society. Much more creativity is needed if we hope to achieve
real learning and real understanding within the antiquated structure of
the education system. The system must do more than simply open its doors;
it must be restructured to value the contributions from persons with
disabilities, from women, and from people with different cultural experiences.
Governments will have to commit themselves to that process through the
provision of founds. And educators will have to be open minded and
innovative in teaching and addressing students. The contribution that
people with a mental handicap make to the education system will have to
be part of the reconstruction of the education system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is time to get rid of the myths and start fresh on creating an inclusive education that provides all children with a
real learning environment.</p>

<p>Equality is new, not old. Until recently, there was no law or constitution in Canada that ensured equality.
Only when the federal and provincial/territorial governments enacted human rights legislation and when, in 1985, the equality
rights provision, section 15, was proclaimed in the <strong>Canadian Charter of Rights and Fredoms</strong> was there any legal authority for
a claim to equality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mental disability was not included in section 15 until the final draft of the <strong>Charter</strong> was drawn up. Then the proclamation of
the equality rights provision was delayed three years after patriation of the constitution. This delay was to give governments
at all levels the opportunity to amend existing legislation to meet the constitutional equality imperative. All jurisdictions
now include protection in human rights legislation for people with mental handicaps but it was not until 1990 that the last
province made the necessary amendment.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_segregation_by_law_and_in_fact">SEGREGATION BY LAW AND IN FACT</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout history, people who have mental handicaps have been disfranchised and subjected to segregation on two fronts:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1) <strong>de jure</strong> (as a matter of law) segregation: which means segregation sanctioned by actual laws (i.e., the law that prohibited
people with mental handicaps from voting); 2) <strong>de facto</strong> (as a matter of fact) segregation: which refers to the various customs
and practices that separate and exclude people labelled mentally handicapped which are taken as facts of life but have no
specific legal sanction (i.e., the practice of confining people with mental handicaps in institutions). It was <strong>de jure</strong>
segregation - legally sanctioned discrimination - which governments, for the most part, were supposed to rectify in their
legislative review under section 15 of the <strong>Charter</strong>. The drafters of the <strong>Charter</strong> acknowledged, by imposing a time delay,
that there were numerous examples of <strong>de jure</strong> discrimination that needed to be rectified. However, both <strong>de jure</strong> and <strong>de facto</strong>
forms of discrimination are open to challenge in court under the terms of the <strong>Charter</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of laws which create <strong>de jure</strong> segregation are: laws that prohibit people with mental handicap from making decisions
for themselves; from voting; from receiving minimum wage; from marrying; and from being jurors. They also include laws that
authorize use of aversive techniques, forced sterilization and unreviewable incarceration. These laws specifically and
explicitly sanction differential treatment. <strong>De jure</strong> segregation has institutionalized prejudice and has had an obvious and
destructive effect. The courts, in interpreting and upholding these laws, prior to the <strong>Charter</strong>, were allowing this prejudice
to exist and were sanctioning the legal devaluation of people with mental handicaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of <strong>de facto</strong> segregation include the practice of warehousing people in institutions, of training or rehabilitating
them in sheltered workshops, and of provifing housing in group homes. These are practices that exclude and implicitlys promote inferior status, worth and position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>De facto</em> segregation appealed natural and proper because of the numerous
examples of legally sanctioned state-approved discrimination.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_segregation_and_the_education_act">SEGREGATION AND THE EDUCATION ACT</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Education for children with mental handicap has been, and continues to
be, a disturbing combination of both forms of segregation. In some
provinces, school acts made specific provisions for children with mental
handicaps to he educated in &#8220;special&#8221; schools and classrooms (<em>de jure</em>).
In other places the practice and policies of school boards has been to
treat children with disabilities as &#8220;special&#8221; and in need of a separate
educational program outside the regular classroom (<em>de facto</em>). However,
the <em>Charter</em> and human rights legislation have provided parents with
powerful new weapons in the fight they wage daily on behalf of their
children to gain access to an equal education.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_first_legal_challenges">The First Legal Challenges</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first case to challenge segregated education, Mr. and Mrs. Balm of
British Columbia, on behalf of their son Arron, claimed that their school
board had failed to fulfil their educational duty of care when it exercised
its statutory power to decide to place the child in a segregated,
self-contained, special school on the basis that the child had a mental
handicap. The <em>Bales v. Central Okangan Board of School Trustees</em> case
was framed in negligence because it took place before the equality rights
provision of <em>Charter</em> came into force.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trial judge held that the <em>School Act</em> did impose a duty on the school
board to provide sufficient school accommodation and tuition, free of
charge, to all children of school age. However, while the judge was
sympathetic to the evidence that integration was becoming the norm, he
followed the judidal tradition of legally sanctioning segegation. It is
notable that this
decision came prior to the existence of any constitutional protections
in Canada.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first <strong>Charter</strong> challange was the <strong>Elwood v. Halifax County-Bedford District School Board</strong> case in NovaScotia. The case was
initiated by the child&#8217;s parents, who began by obtaining an injunction against the school board. The injunction prohibited school
board officials from transferring their child, Luke, from his neighbourhood school where he had been registered and placed in a
regular classroom with the help of the principal. The school board had told the parents it intended to return him to the
segregated class for children with disabilities located in another school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parents claimed that their child had the constitutional right to the equal benefit both before and under the education law
and the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of a mental disability under s. 15 of the <strong>Charter</strong>. The school board
countered on the basis that the education act gave the board the power to make all placement decisions. School board officials
strongly resisted acknowledging that the practice of placing all children with disabilities together in a self-contained
classroom could constitute unlawful discrimination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the year after the injunction the parties exchanged evidence in preparation for the trial. Shortly before the trial was to
begin, a settlement agreement was proposed on behalf of Luke. The agreement detailed a model situation for Luke in bis
neighbourhood school in a regular classroom. The case was settled on the basis of this proposed agreement in favour of the child.
Because all cases involving an infant claimant which are settled prior to trial must be approved by the court, the
<strong>Elwood v. Halifax County-Bedford District School Board</strong> agreement is incorporated into the final court order.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_amendments_pave_the_way_to_integration">Amendments Pave the Way to Integration</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More recently, education statutes have been amended to specifically exclude reference to differential treatment but they do not provide any explicit obligation to fully include all children in regular classrooms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, education statutes refer to a general right for children
to receive an education, but the power is vested in the school board to
decide where to place children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one notable exception to this general rule. Arguably the most
progressive education legslative provisions to advance the interests of
children with a disability are found in the <em>Schools Act</em> in New Brunswick.
After defining exmptionalities in terms of behavioural, communication,
intellectual, physical, perceptual, or multiple, the <em>Act</em> directs that
a school board:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>shall place exceptional pupils such that they receive special education
programs in circumstances where exceptional pupils can participate with
pupils who are not exceptional pupils within regular classroom settings
to the extent that is considered practicable by the school board having
due regard for the educational needs of all Pupils.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite these amendments, children continued to be segregated in New
Brunswick, particularly in francophone school districts. The Robichaud
family of New Brunswick objected to the segregation of their teenage
daughter in a special class to children with disabilities. The parents
removed Nathalie from the segregated setting and were keeping her at home.
They began proceedings by applying for a mandatory injunction which would
require the school board to place Nathalie in a regular high school classroom.
The court which heard their application interpreted the education
legislation as specifically providing each child, regardless of disability,
with the right to be educated in a regular classroom alongside his or her
non-disabled peers. The court accepted the argument of the parents that
the <em>Schools Act</em> was consistent with the equality requirement in the
<em>Charter</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The family argued and the court held that the Act was constitutional and
enforceable in Nathalie&#8217;s favour because it required a school board to
provide the equal educational benefit to all children including those who
have a disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal which held that the lower court judge had misapplied the test for granting an
injunction. While the Court Appeal overturned the lower court ruling in <strong>relation to the relief sought</strong>, it ordered that the
injunction was to remain in place until the end of the school year. Prior to the beginning of the next school term,the matter
was settled in favour of the child. A settlement agreement which required that Nathalie be integrated was approved by court order.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_profincial_territorial_responsibility">Profincial/Territorial Responsibility</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada has not had the opportunity to rule on the question of whether there is a constitutional right for
all children to attend school in their neighhourhood in a regular class. The court has, however, stressed the importance of the
State providing an education to its citizens. The constitution has continually made education the exclusive jurisdiction of the
provinces. It can be argued that, where the provincial/territorial government has undertaken through legislation to provide an
education, that education must be provided without discrimination to meet the constitutional standard imposed on provinces and
territories by s.15.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legislation typically enables the education minister to delegate responsibility for the day-to-day education and administration
to school board officials. In addition to holding school hoards accountable for the practice of segregating children with mental
disabilities, some parents have made simultaneous claims against ministers of education who have the ultimate statutory duty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The recent settlement of the <em>Charter</em> challenge in Ontario, <em>Hysert v. Carleton Board of Education et al.</em>, demonstrates the
importance of asserting a shared responsibility with the provincial or territorial government. The case was settled just prior
to trial when the attorney general advised counsel for the school board that the government intended to amend
its statement of defence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It changed its position to support the child&#8217;s claim that she had a right
to be integrated. This is thought to be the first time in the country
when an attorney general clearly came out in favour of the disadvantaged
person in a <em>Charter</em> challenge.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_claims_under_human_rights_legislation">CLAIMS UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to claims to equality under the <em>Charter</em> and provincial or
territorial education legislation, some people have made complaints under
human rights. Two factors bring education under the domain of human
rights:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>despite conflicting legal judgements, schools have been held to be a
public service or facility under human rights legislation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in all provinces and territories, mental and physical disability are
prohibited grounds for discrimination. Anti-discrimination laws can address
policy and practice of people and organizations within both the public
and private sectors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basis of a complaint is that it is discriminatory to segregate
children because they have a mental disability in self-contained, &#8220;special&#8221;
schools or classrooms, as this denies them access to a public facility or
service (the school) that is customarily available to the public it serves
(children).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first human rights complaint involving a child with a mental handicap
that went to a hearing, was initiated on the basis of religious
discrimination. The Catholic school board in the county of Lanark, Leeds
and Grenville in Ontario required all children with mental handicaps to
attend one class operated by a secular school board. This meant that
Catholic children with a mental handicap could not receive instruction in
a separate school in the religion of their choice. The arrangement made
between the boards dictating that all &#8220;special needs&#8221; children would
be educated at one site was done for administrative convenience.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_human_rights_complaint_mechanism_fail_to_respond">Human Rights Complaint Mechanism Fail to Respond</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The number of complaints to human rights commissions has grown in recent years with little increase in their funding.
The resulting backlog means there are many unresolved complaints of educational discrimination. The tragedy of the situation is
that human rights complaint mechanisms have not produced the swift, accessible justice they were meant to provide. The result is
that some children continue to be retained in segregated settings, taught at home or placed by their parents in alternative
schools as interim measures while a complaint is being processed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is impossible to calculate the long-term damages to children who have been denied the academic and social benefits of regular
classes and who have been ostracized in front of their communities. Two glaring examples of this unacceptable situation are the
<em>Becky Till v. North York School Board</em> case, a complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Commission, and the
<em>Zebrowski v. School Trustees</em> case, a complaint to the Manitoba Human Rights Commission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even where a complaint is investigated, idiosyncrasies of the different human rights commission offices sometimes impede justice.
In a recent decision following an investigation, the P.E.I. Human Rights Commission alluded to discrimination but did not appoint
 a board of inquiry .While the commission directed integration to take place, they did not specify how or when the school board
 was to carry out the integration, and failed to indicate how they intended to monitor the action of the board in light of the
 decision. The letter to the complainant advising her of the result indicated that if no steps were taken by the school board,
 she could advise the commission adingly and it would intervene.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, them are numerous examples in various provinces and territories where the human rights
commission has assumed a role in arbitrating a settlement and the matter has been resolved in favour of the child.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_education_appeal_mechanisms">EDUCATION APPEAL MECHANISMS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some jurisdictions, parents can use special statutory appeal
mechanisms to question decisions to place their children in
segregated settings. These mechanisms have been established specifically
for children labelled as having &#8220;special needs&#8221;. However, this appeal
process has been rejected by many parents and advocates because they
claim it is biased. If the statutory appeal mechanism allows the decision
maker to discuss the question of whether a child should be included or
not, it is inherently discriminatory. If parents were convinced that the
appeal process would deal with education content and not with the actual
validity of integration, people might not perceive the appeal process as
biased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some jurisdictions, the appeal mechanism under education legislation
provides for a final appeal to the minister of education. A recent
decision by the minister under the <em>equivalent section</em> in Alberta came
out alter a lengthy, organized appeal by the family and supporters of the
child, Margaret Eggert. The decision came out strongly in favour of the
child entering Grade 1 in her neighbourhood school.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_parents_carry_the_struggle">PARENTS CARRY THE STRUGGLE</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The element that permeates all of the legal challenges by parents on
behalf of their children is one of struggle. There is no universal
acceptance of children labelled disabled within the education system. At
every turn, parents must spend time, effort, money and emotion on
justifying their child&#8217;s right to be included. Resources are continually
being poured into &#8220;special&#8221; education while there is little effort to
find ways of making inclusion happen. There is little exploration of the
social and academic benefits to all children and the economic benefits to
the whole of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strategies developed by parents have been creative and intense, and
strengthened by the involvement of family members, friends and advocates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Elwood case, Luke was in his neighbourhood school during the year befone his trial, and his fellow students and classroom
teacher became his greatest allies. The evidence given by people closest to the child ran contrary to the position taken by
the school board, which no doubt inspired the school board to settle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In cases where the minister of education was implicated, the politics of the situation became critical. In the Margaret Eggert
case, wide-spread positive media coverage exerted suffcient political pressure to influence the decision in favour of the child.
In the Alexandra Hysert case, the attorney general saw that the government policy on integation ran counter to the position
adopted in its defense to the child&#8217;s claim. The emberrassment of the inconsistency compelled the government to change sides,
leaving the school hoard disempowered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order for segregation, both <em>dejure</em> and <em>de facto</em>, to be dismantled, it must he challenged on all fronts. While segregation
persists, the non-disabled community will never have the opportunity to relate to people with disabilities as full and
participating citizens. One has only to visit a truly integrated school, speak to one of the educators responsible for the
implementation of an equality setting, or meet with any of the students benefitting from a situation where all children are
included, to truly appredate the result. There are some Canadian jurisdictions that provide outstanding models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as people must struggle in courts for inclusion, others will continue to see disability as something negative and treat
people with disabilities differently. The stereotypical impression of people with disabilities, that they must qualify to be
anything but excluded and devalued, will continue to be the norm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>School board administrators and ministers of education must realize that legally sanctioned segregation has rendered people with
mental handicaps powerless and disadvantaged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The equality requirement in the <em>Charter</em> is intended to, and will
mandate, the inclusion of all children.
It will be interpreted by the courts as requiring the dismantling of
segregation. The power of parents to act on behalf of their children is
based on the child&#8217;s constitutional and legal guarantees. Where the goal
is inclusion, the power of parents is inexhaustible. It will continue to
whittle away at the barriers that persist in practioe and in law. Those
who resist the inevitable transition to integation should recognize that
because the power of parents is exercised in the name of equality, it
will prevail.</p>

<h3 id="_principles_of_change_a_parent_s_perspective_on_the_education_system">Principles of Change: A Parent&#8217;s Perspective on the Education System</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by David Jory</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his last year at school, Grade 12, our son, John, who has Down Syndrome, was fully integrated for the first time into regular
classrooms. He spent only two hours a week outside the regular class when he practised reading and speaking with a teacher.
He also attended job sites under a work-study program. Parents should note that it is important to have a definition of
integration which permits and encourages things like work-study programs; some definitions I have heard would prevent them if
taken literally. In fact, John had a better time in Grade 12 than did his older sister or younger brother. This was not an
accident; it came about in part because of a great deal of learning on our&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;his parents&#8217;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;part and on the part of some
teachers and administrators, to whom we pay tribute. What we learned made us seriously question much of the ideology and many
of the theories upon which the special education system is based.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we began to think about the kind of education our child with Down Syndrome needed, it was 1978, when the jargon we now use
was unknown in New Brunswick. As we felt that what was going on wasn&#8217;t appropriate, we had to learn to explain what we wanted
in ways the people in the system would understand and respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also learned that, rather than trying to do it all alone, parents are much better off combining our efforts
with a group of people with similar ideas. Our parents&#8217; group was helped by staff at the national office of what are now
the Canadian Association for Community Living and The Roeher Institute. They explained concepts, provided information and
helped us organize our ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rosi, my wife, and I realized that five simple principles would lead to the kind of education system we wanted:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>adapt the system and the curriculum to the pupil;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>educate all pupils together in the same class;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make the school system accountable to the pupils;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognize that the real expert on a pupil is usually his or her parent(s);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the pupil with a mental handicap, make the transition to the real world of work gradual, beginning years before the pupil
leaves school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_from_system_centred_to_pupil_centred_education">FROM SYSTEM-CENTRED TO PUPIL-CENTRED EDUCATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rosi and I were disappointed to find that these simple principles were
not generally accepted in the education system, and even when they were
accepted in theory they were not put wholeheartedly into practice. In
fact, we found our principles to be threatening to some people in the
education system. This was because most school systems are
&#8220;system-centred&#8221;; the needs and convenience of teachers and
administrators generally take precedence over the needs of pupils. The
reasons are sometimes beyond the control of the teachers and
administrators, such as a lack of money and resources resulting in
oversized classes. Teachers and administrators will say that their
systems are pupil-centred, but if parents look closely they will see
that they are mainly system-centred with some superficial concessions
to pupil-centred practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a system-centred school, the evaluation schemes, such as tests, marks
and grades, are mainly &#8220;norm-reverenced&#8221;. This means they are based on
the abilities and achievements of &#8220;average&#8221; or &#8220;normal&#8221; pupils at
each grade level. Teachers must teach for these &#8220;normal&#8221; pupils whether
they want to or not, and many good teachers would rather not. Very good
pupils become bored and pupils with a mental handicap are bound to fail.
In other words, pupils must adapt to fit the system; if they do not, or
cannot, they suffer the consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we discovered, for a school system to follow our first principle and
adapt structure and curriculum to the pupil, it must change its whole way
of operating and become &#8220;criterion-referenced&#8221;. In a criterion-referenced
school, the evaluation scheme is based on the abilities of individual
pupils. Brilliant pupils are expected to do more than the &#8220;average&#8221;
pupil and are evaluated according to whether their work matches their
abilities. The majority of pupils work at roughly the same level and are
evaluated accordingly. The pupil with a mental handicap is given work at
his or her level and is evaluated according to whether or not he or she
does the work well. In this way the pupil with a mental handicap can
succeed as well as any other pupil because he or she is required to do
only what he or she actually can do. This system allows for <em>all</em> pupils
who require an adapted curriculum to receive it, not just the pupils with
a mental handicap, removing some of the stigma assodated with an adapted
curriculum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During our efforts, Rosi and I also discovered that we weren&#8217;t alone;
many progressive thinkers and educators shared our ideas.
Teachers, administrators, school board trustees and researchers are coming
to understand that future national prosperity and social justice depend
on maximizing the potential of each pupil. This means ensuring that each
pupil gets the best education he or she is capable of acquiring, which
is achieved by making our school systems more pupil-centred and less
system-centred.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also achieved by applying good integration techniques to all pupils.
In our struggle for appropriate education for  &#8220;exceptional students&#8221;
(the term used in our province for all pupils who require an adapted program)
parents can seek out these potential allies, make them aware that we are
allies and work with them. They can work to change the system from inside,
while we work for change from the outside. Experience has shown that
determined leadership and clear goals make a pupil-centred school system
a possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a pupil-centred school the arguments for keeping pupils with a mental
handicap out of the regular classroom have no validity.
So our second principle, to educate all pupils together in the same class,
is a natural outcome of the first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our third principle, to make the school system accountable to the pupil,
is also an extension of the first principle and is stated separately as
a reminder that the school system serves parents and their children&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;we
do not serve it. Too frequently the school system blame the pupil or the
parents for whatever goes wrong with the pupil&#8217;s education. When the
school system fails any pupil it must be held accountable for its failure.
This accountability encourages acceptance that the education of all pupils
is the joint responsibility of the school system, the parents and their
children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our fourth principle, to recognize that the real expert on a pupil is
usually his or her parent(s), is based on this joint responsibility and
applies to all pupils, not just those with a disability. However, parent
involvement is particularly important in the case of a pupil with a mental
handicap. Most people in regular school systems have little or no
experience with such pupils. Moreover, there are relatively few pupils
with a mental handicap, and there is great variation between them, which
means teachers and administrators will lack understanding of a particular
pupil&#8217;s capabilities. Rosi and I know our son better than anyone else
does; we know his capabilities and how he learns best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our fifth principle, to make a gradual transition from school to work, was developed when we realized that our son could learn a
skill in one setting but could not necessarily perform that same skill in another setting. This is called &#8220;low skill transference
ability&#8221; in jargon. We saw that sheltered workhops&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in which people with mental handicaps are supposedly trained forjobs in the
real world&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are almost total failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our local school board was one step ahead of us and had set up a work-study program for its pupils with a mental handicap.
Work-study programs are vital if our children with mental handicaps are to have a decent life. They cannot learn about the real
world of work while in school; they need opportunities to learn how to work in the workplace itself. Segregated schooling leading
to segregated sheltered workshops creates lives of dependency, frustration, anguish and desperation in institutions. Children with
handicaps deserve much more than that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_conflict_between_parent_principles_and_system_assumptions">THE CONFLICT BETWEEN PARENT PRINCIPLES AND SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to point out that our principles challenge a number of basic assumptions about the way schools operate. Although
most of the teachers and administrators who had direct responsibility for our son&#8217;s education had appropriate and sometimes
phenomenal attitudes, we found major problems at the system and structural levels. We were led to think about these problems by
system failures and the experiences of other parents. In fact, our principles raise a fundamental question that we thought had
been resolved long ago: are all pupils to be given a chance or are some, as George Orwell said, &#8220;more equal than others&#8221;?
There are educators who still believe there should be gatekeepers armed with &#8220;objective assessments&#8221; to keep pupils with a mental
handicap separate from friends and peers. We also know principals, teachers and especially medical doctors who tell parents that
children with a mental handicap are sub-human.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_case_against_special_ed">THE CASE AGAINST &#8220;SPECIAL ED&#8221;</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We believe that special education should he challenged. It is a faulty system based on a series of myths and failed models.
And it is a menace to our children.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_different_needs">Different Needs</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One myth is that some pupils are so different from others that they must he dealt with through a separate sub-system of the
education system. This myth, of course, belongs to a normreferenced and system-centred education system. Special education serves
to segregate some pupils so the rest of the class will be roughly at the same level and can be taught as a group, not as
individual students with different needs. However, special education does not allow for the fact that segregated pupils are not
at the same level; they have different needs and cannot he taught <em>en masse</em>. The knowledge and experience that does exist in
special education could be better used to help regular teachers in regular classes teach exceptional pupils. We found many
researchers who now question the value and usefulness of special education, confirming our belief that its theoretical
justifications are without foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pupils are not better served in segregated settings. Our son learned
skills in many non-segregated settings&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;at the YMCA, volleyball camp,
minor soccer, various jobs, and at home&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only at school did people feel
he had to be segregated with &#8220;others like him&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the change in attitudes, special education still has many defenders
and it provides many jobs. The faculties of education at our universities
are one of its major defenders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our province, proponents of special education in universities simply
deny that all children can be included in regular classes, even in the face
of concrete examples that inclusion can work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_support_from_research">Support from Research</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another myth is that research supports traditional special education.
We looked at some of the research used to support special education
and found that it was poorly disigned, poorly interpreted and not relevant
to existing reality. In fact, research today shows that it supports
integration rather than segregation for students with a disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parents should question the quality and validity of education research
in general. Science is not objective and research experiments are
designed to produce the results the researcher wants to produce.
Experiments are carried out by people to get degrees, jobs, promotions
or professional status. In addition, education is an intensely personal
interaction between people whose moods and attitudes vary from minute
to minute. The use of adaptations of scientific methods designed to study
inanimate things seems inadequate for the study of education.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_holes_in_the_cascade_theory">The Holes in the Cascade Theory</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Special education generally supports the model of a continuum of learning
environments from total segregation to total integration in the regular
classroom. Pupils are supposed to progress along this continuum towards
the regular classroom, which they are supposed to reach eventually but
never do. This is the Cascade model, which it would be more appropriate
to call the &#8220;anywhere but in the regular classroom&#8221; model. It is incredibly
wasteful because the many different learning environments must be staffed
by special education personnel and pupils must be brought in from far and
wide to provide the required numbers at each level. The real figures show
that most of the movement in the cascade is from less segregated
environments to more segregated environments and that it is unusual for
a pupil to progress successfully from a segregated environment to a
regular classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model fails for many reasons. How can a pupil learn how
to behave in a regular classroom if he has never been in one
but has always been segregated with other pupils who do not
know how to behave in a regular classroom? Pupils with a mental
handicap need continuity and consistency in order to perform well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as we found with our son&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but how can they be expected to
survive the discontinuities, inconsistencies and continued changes
inherent in the Cascade model? It seems that any pupil who can
successully fight this way into a regular classroom through the Cascade
model should have been in the regular classroom from the beginning.
That was certainly the case with our son.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A further danger is that, though the Cascade model is clearly segregationist,
some people claim it is an integration model. This enables people in school
systems to claim to support integration by supporting the Cascade model
when in fact they support segregation and rejection. The Cascade model
also encourages and rewards teachers who reject pupils whose educational
needs they cannot or will not meet. The teacher fails the pupil, so the
pupil is thrown out of the class and becomes someone else’s problem. The
model&#8217;s existence also continues to waste scarce resources on segregation
that would be better spent on true integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Early in the move towards integration, well-meaning administrators promoted
the Cascade model, no doubt because it represented advanced special education
theory. The support waned when its segregatiouist nature became obvious.
However, the model can be made to sound reasonable and protective, and
its ideological underpinnings are not always evident, making it the most
dangerous weapon in the special education arsenal. It will continually
appear like a deadly virus and we must be on our guard against it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_socialisation_and_learning">Socialisation and Learning</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet another myth fostered by special education theory is that children
with a mental handicap will be socialized better in the regular class,
but that their academic work will suffer.
We were once told that this was the trade-off and that we would have to
make a choice between socialization and education for our son. People who
say things like that seem to believe that children with a mental handicap
have little understanding and no feeling. They are wrong. Parents will
understand what we mean when we say our son is slow, not stupid. He and
his friends understood quite well that they were in segregated classes
bcause they had been rejected by the regular school system because they
were considered inferior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When our son had a chance to go into a regular class he reacted well
because he clearly felt he now belonged. He worked harder and progressed
more quickly than he had in the segregated classes. Better socializafion
had a positive, not a negative, effect on his academic progress. A pupil
who is surrounded by other pupils behaving normally is likely to behave
normally and to work as others work. A pupil in a segregated class is
likely to be distracted by behaviours around him or her and imitate them,
rather than working.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most segregated classes provide less individual attention than regular
classes, making them inferior learning environments. This was true of the
segregated classes our son attended, despite the efforts of excellent
teachers in those segregated classes. Some of those teachers who went on
to teach in regular classes told us that, in a segregated class, each
exceptional pupil gets only five to ten minutes of individual attention
on most days. A properly organized teacher with a regular class containing
an exceptional pupil can provide more than ten minutes of individual
attention to the exceptional pupil without short-changing the non-exceptional
pupils. So not only is the learning environment better in a regular class,
but experience suggests that there are more opportunities for individual
attention.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_assessments_off_exceptional_students">Assessments off exceptional Students</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our five simple principles also call into question the assessment
procedures on which special education feeds. The people doing assessments
in the school system often function as gate keepers; in most schools, a
child assessed as having a mental handicap is turned away at the front
door of the education system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our son has proved wrong every such assessment he has ever had. But why
did he have to? The gatekeepers turned him away from the regular school
system and it took him twelve years to fully fight his way back in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While in-class assessments in the regular classroom setting can be useful
in determining appropriate work levels, assessments which claim to predict
in detail what a pupil will or will not be able to learn are dangerous.
They, and the rejection which follows them, have a devastating effect on
the self-esteem of the pupil. Segregators do not seem to understand or care.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assessments associated with &#8220;placements&#8221; are almost invariably designed
to find out what the child cannot do, rather than what he can do.
Assessments are almost invariably used against the child. Since the only
acceptable placement is in the regular classroom, predictive assessments
have no function and no ethical, educational or legal justification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people who argue for assessments say that exceptional pupils must be
divided up into sub-categories such as mentally retarded, physically
disabled or with behaviour problems. This is equivalent to setting up a
category of immigrant pupils and sub-dividing them into Christian black-
skinned, Christian bnown-skinned, Moslem brown-skinned, and so on. School
systems should be sensitive to the education needs of pupils as <em>individuals</em>,
not as groups. Our son is more like his brother and sister than like other
children with Down Syndrome. There are no special teaching techniques that
apply only to pupils with Down Syndrome.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_parents_partners">PARENTS, PARTNERS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many segregotionists within school systems cannot accept our principle
that &#8220;the expert on a pupil is usually the parent&#8221;. In fact,the way a
person in the education system responds to that principle is often a good
indication of that person&#8217;s openness to integration. Many good teachers
and administrators welcome the participation of parents, and other support
personnel, in the overall educational enterprise. Other teachers and
administrators say they fear a loss of control over the classroom.
Or they seem to reject the idea that parents have anything useful to otfer.
These fears should be dealt with sympathetically because the successful
education of a pupil with a mental handicap and, increasingly, of other
pupils, <em>requires</em> parent-teacher-administrator cooperation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We find these fears are based on emotion rather than fact, and there is
plenty of experience to show that the fears are generally unfounded. One
of the most heart-warming aspects of our efforts over the years was seeing
some teachers who were afraid of &#8220;integration&#8221; become its strongest
advocates once they tried it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We feel teachers and administrators have developed their fears through
incorrect information and attitudes taught by faculties of education. In
many cases, we see the teachers and administrators as the victims of <em>their</em>
education. We find that the faculties of education of all but a handful
of our Canadians universities desperately cling to outdated segregationist
ideology and concepts based on out-of-date research. They refuse to give
teachers the training they need to enable them to provide an appropriate,
integrated education for <em>all</em> pupils. We have come to the sad conclusion
that most faculties of education are incompetent in this major area. On
the other hand this means that we, as parents, should be prepared to help
and support willing teachers and administrators who want to do the right
thing but do not know how.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_iep">THE IEP</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parent-teacher-administrator cooperation is important in the formulation
of the curriculum or program fur the pupil with a mental handicap. If a
pupil with a mental handicap is forced to follow the same curriculum as
pupil without a mental handicap he or she will fail. For the time being
the best vehicle for cooperation is the Individual Education Plan (IEP).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IEPs were originally introduced in the United States because teachers
leaked experience in teaching exceptional pupils and it was deemed necessary
to impose a mechanism to ensure parent involvement and teacher accountability.
In that context, IEPs were a productive mechanism, and they can still be
helpful. They provide a means of measuring what an exceptional pupil learns,
making it more difficult to blame the pupil if thing do not go well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An IEP should he drawn up carefully and cooperatively but without becoming
a major production. The regular classroom teacher may sometimes want to
turn to a resource person for advice on the program and its implementation,
and the parent may want to turn to another experienced parent. The pupil can
often he involved. In exceptional cases, a psychologist or even a doctor
may be involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IEP is reviewed and revised cooperatively at regular intervals and
should be treated as a guide, not a straitjacket. It also does not
guarantee that all will suddenly be well; in fact, educational crimes have
been committed against pupils in the name of IEPs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An IEP is best viewed as a confidence-building mechanism for the parent,
the teacher and the administrator, and the pupil. The parent and teacher
must he honest and realistic. Parents can tell the teacher how the pupil
learns best, what he is interested in, how he reacts in particular
situations, how to avoid problems, and so on. If things go wrong or there
is dissatisfaction, all concerned must avoid any temptation to blame someone,
and instead concentrate on finding solutions cooperatively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We found that IEPs were not necessary when our son had good, experienced
teachers who were committed to integration. We have also known parents
whose children have had poor teachers despite IEPs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_word_of_caution">A WORD OF CAUTION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although our principles are simple, putting them into practice is difficult.
Parents should be wary of people who promote simple answers to the complex
questions facing education today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One potentially dangerous cry is &#8220;back to the basics&#8221;. Any education system
built around the back-to-the-basics theme will be system-centred and
norm-referenced with no place for exceptional pupils. Securing a decent
education for exceptional children means supporting integation, with all
the inherent challenges involved. It means supporting theories and practices
that are called progressive, rather than those that are called conservative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also important to realise that our society asks the impossible of
teachers and school administrators. We expect them to resolve all our social
problems and have all kinds of programs such as AIDS and anti-racism education
and propaganda from the nuclear industry. Integration means appropriate
education for <em>all</em> pupils and is best accomplished when teachers are not
over-stressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parents should support efforts to reduce class size, eliminate curriculum
overload and improve support services for teachers; parents should also
support rewards for exceptional teachers. Parents must resist any
postponement of integration based on the excuse that the system is not ready.
lf the time, effort and money spent opposing integration were spent implementing
it, integration would be a reality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System-wide integration can work; good teachers and administrators have
discovered that they can integrate exceptional students much better
than they thought possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ideology of segregation, while still very much alive, is now having
to hide and adopt new tactics. We believe that continued, consitent pressure
to apply our five principles can keep the segregationists on the run, and
help all those in our school systems who want to provide an appropriate,
inclusive education for all pupils.</p>

<h3 id="_the_road_to_inclusion_one_family_s_story">The Road to Inclusion: One Family&#8217;s Story</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Alene Steinbeck</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many dimensions to every story of integration: one that is often
overlooked is the impact on family life. What does integration mean on
the human level, away from school board meeting and resource teachers?
Every family experiences joys and trials in the course of their child&#8217;s
development: the first day of school, the move to a new neighbourhood and
a new school, the formation of new friendships. What dimension does the
constant struggle for inclusion in the regular school system add to these
experiencies?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My family&#8217;s story shows integration from this perspective&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one which is
often overlooked. It is the story of education and of how education leads
to many other things in life. It is a story of friendship, love, community
and the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I realize, as I look back at my earlier experiences and education, that
I never had the opportunity to know people who talked or walked differently
from me, or who were labelled mentally handicapped, or who used a wheelchair.
I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to feel natural or confident around people
who were different from myself. My entire generation lacked this experience,
which led many of us to believe that people with differences did not belong
in our community; they belonged somewhere else, some place &#8220;special&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That belief was first shaken in 1979 when, in a Canadian hospital in Lahr,
West Germany, a beautiful baby girl with big blue eyes and brown hair was
born in to our family. We called her Mandy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several days following Mandy&#8217;s birth, my husband and I received shocking
news. The doctors suspected that Mandy had been born with an ertra chromosme
or, as it is better known, Down Syndrome. My head spun. How could it be?
With a pounding heart I hurried back to my room to cuddle my long-awaited
baby girl and stare at the face I already loved so dearly. As I held her
close, I tried to imagine what the future would hold for our family.
All I new was that I was her mother and she belonged with me. A nurse soon
advised me to put my baby down as I was becoming much too attached to her.
She said, &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do either of you any good&#8221;. Her words left me feeling
angry, confused, defensive and alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was several weeks before I found the courage to phone my parents to inform
them of the birth of their first granddaughter. I was unprepared for their
total acceptance of Mandy. Their support and acceptance were invaluable
in helping me cope at that moment and in the years to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel fortunate that we had the foresight to reject the advice of the
doctors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the beliefs of our generation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and refuse to institutionalize
our child. I will never regret the decision which set my family on a
challenging road filled with obstacles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the years to come Mandy herself would challenge us all. She would have
a powerful impact on our lives and on the direction we would take together
as a family. As the mother of a child labelled mentally handicapped, I
would have to continually give explanations, challenge conventional decsions
and advocate for her rights. Mandy forced me to look for answers, to make
choices and decisions. The very people I nespected and admired in life
became my adversaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mandy enrolled me in a world of battle, a world I new nothing about.
This was especially true of our educational system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_first_years_of_school">THE FIRST YEARS OF SCHOOL</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People&#8217;s attitudes proved to be one of the greatest barriers. People felt
that Mandy had to master an array of skills before she could join the lives
of neighbours, friends and schoolmates. I was told that people needed time
to get &#8220;ready&#8221;, and attitudes needed to &#8220;change&#8221; before she could be accepted
into their schools. In other words, positive attitudes of the community
and of the teachers were requisite for Mandy to attend school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I believed that Mandy could not wait for people&#8217;s attitudes to change.
I felt she belonged in the regular school system with her peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Mandy was four years old, our family was transferred to Ottawa, Ontario.
I enrolled Mandy in a nursery school for special needs children. I grappled
with my conscience at doing this, and, after monitoring Mandy&#8217;s progress
for several months, I gave in to the gnawing feeling that she was in the
wrong place. How was she going to make friends in her neighbourhood and
learn to cope with everyday situations if she was segregated from other
children?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After making many inquiries, I arranged for Mandy to attend a local daycare
centre that had set aside three seats in their program for children with
mental handicaps. Mandy spent an exciting year there. As she blossomed we
saw many changes in her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of this year, much to our disappointment, Mandy was denied access
to the junior kindergarten program in the same school as the daycare centre.
The teacher did not feel she could handle a child with a handicap in her
classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This threw me into indecision. Did Mandy really deserve the same things
other children took for granted? Was I being realistic?
I wondered if I should I just give up&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which would have been the easier
route&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or if I should persevere, doing what I felt was right for Mandy
and helping others to see Mandy as I did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should I challenge this system that wanted to keep her out of their lives?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision was made. We felt that education was for everyone and that
Mandy should and could belong. We decided to approach the school down the
street from our home, the same school her older brother, Justin, was
attending.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My husband and I met with the principal and discussed my thoughts and
beliefs, and my desire to enrol Mandy in the next school year in their
junior kindergarten program. He said they did not have any children with
handicap at this school; however, did I know of the special school across
town for the mentally retarded? I assured him that I was aware of it but
was not interested in visiting the special school, nor was I considering
it an option for my daughters education. The principal was genuinely supportive
and optimistic as he tried to understand my concept. He told me that he
would consider my request and would bring it up at the next meeting with
his superiors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we waited with anticipation, the summer months flew by and fall was
upon us. The first day of school approached and still we waited for an
answer. Finally, the Friday before school was to begin, the phone call
came. That phone call changed our lives. Mandy was to start school on
Monday with her brother. We were ecstatic!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following year was exciting, with none of the anticipated obstacles
or problems. It really was an ordinary school year. Mandy was just another
kid at school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her presence at school that year had a major impact on people&#8217;s lives,
including her brother&#8217;s. One day, during Education Week, I received a phone
call from Justin&#8217;s Grade 4 teacher. She wanted to share with me an emotional
experience she had witnessed that day at school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of her pupils had been required to choose a topic related to education,
write about it and present it to the rest of the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher said that she became concerned when it was Justin&#8217;s turn;
there he stood at the front of the class with no written material prepared.
He proceeded to tell the class that he had chosen to talk about his sister,
her life and what his family&#8217;s dreams were for her. He spoke about the label
society had given her, about her struggles, her accomplishments and about
how she was just like the other students. She like to skate, watch vidios,
go to school, and play with her friends, and her favourite singer was Michael
Jackson. Justin concluded by telling the class that he did not need to write
down on paper or prepare beforehand what he knew was right because it came
naturally from his heart. l was told that this presentation not only moved
the entire classroom to tears, including the teacher, but that it was also
the most educational presentation the teacher had ever heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>June came and the school year was winding down when the news came: our
family was being transferred to Oromocto, New Brunswick. It sounded like
the other end of the earth. What was to become of Mandy and her education?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With just two days left in the school year and only days before we left
for our new home, the school principal called and asked my husband and I
to meet with him the next day. Not knowing what it was all about, and
feeling both apprehensive and curious, we went to the school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon our arrival, we were escorted into a crowded board room filled with
people&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;teachers and administrators who had been directly involved with
Mandy, and other teachers whose only experience had been to say hi to her
in the halls.
To our surprise, they all thanked my husband and I for giving <em>them</em> the
opportunity to have Mandy at their school. They told us how sorry they
were to see us leave and that they wished we were staying in Ottawa for
at least three more years. They added that they hoped Mandy had learned
as much from them as they had learned from her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a moment I will never forget. It sealed my beliefs; I made an added
commitment to our family&#8217;s direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I later learned that Mandy&#8217;s presence had set a precedent; the
following year the school had three children with special needs enrolled
in regular classes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_new_city_new_challenges">NEW CITY, NEW CHALLENGES</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I arrived in New Brunswick I was consumed with mixed emotions. I
dreaded my new neighbours&#8217; reactions to our family; I feared that I would
have to explain and fight all over again. It was difficult to have left
everything that made me feel safe and secure: my family and my friends.
I felt a tremendous burden on my shoulders. Everything had been going so
great; and now I suddenly felt desperately alone!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it was upon moving to New Brunswick that I learned there was a special
word for my beflef that Mandy should and could participate in regular
classes with other neighbourhood children. The word is integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That September both kids started school&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Mandy in regular kindergarten
and Justin in Grade 5 at the same school.
While things were off to a smooth start, I soon heard that there was to
be a review of school policy regarding integration. A concerned teacher
at the school convinced me that it was important that parents like myself
become involved in the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I began making phone calls to other parents who were considering integating
their children. I explained to them that I had recently moved from Ontario
and, like them, had a child with special needs. I asked them if they new
that changes to school policy regarding integration of children with exceptional
needs were under review. We talked about how important it was that we as
parents contribute and voice our opinions and concerns. We agreed that we
needed to meet each other and discuss the impending changes which would
effect our lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every person I called&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which added up to ten families&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;came to a meeting
at my home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We sat with cups of coffee and shared stories, concerns, ideas and plans
for the future. The atmosphere of this first meeting was one of caring
and sharing; it was both exciting and rejuvenating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After everyone left that evening, and as I sat alone in my living room,
I was filled with a new, warm, safe feeling. I wasn&#8217;t alone at all. I knew
then that everything was going to be alright It was a wonderful feeling
to finally share and discuss how I felt&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;my frustrations, worries,
thoughts and actions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;with other people who understood. It lifted the
weight off my shoulders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The group was immediately active, following the burning issue of integration,
and keeping up-to-date on progress, espacially in the school system. We
prepared and mailed documents to the school district, informing them of
the formation of our parent group. In our letter, we spoke of our support
for their endeavours to integrate children with exceptional needs into the
regular school system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A formal presentation to the school board was the next item on our agenda.
As the designated leader of the parent support group I was responsible for
the presentation: the first one I&#8217;d ever given! Despite my nervousness,
the response was tremendous; our report of our expectations drew the attention
of many school board members and the media. We continued to attend school
board meetings and were called upon to discuss and comment on other school
policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The years were both positive and rewarding, not only for our family but
for our community. The parent group continued, becoming a united voice,
a resource to other parents and to the community, and a source of strength
for one another. Because we stood together we saw many significant and
exiting changes in our schools and our community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important outcome of our efforts was that Mandy was permanently
integrated into the regular school system in Oromocto, New Brunswick.
Integration meant that she became a part of one school system that exists
for <em>all</em> children. It provided the opportunity for her to learn, to
participate and to play with her friends in and out of the school.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_fabric_of_the_community">THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mandy now has friends; I think this is one of the greatest benefits of
inclusion. For years I watched Mandy stand alone on the front lawn as all
the neighbourhood children rushed by on their way to school or games. I
remembered thinking, &#8220;Please just one person stop and talk to her; just
one of you ask her to play too.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My eyes fill with tears when I remember the first time our doorbell rang
and there stood three little girls asking, &#8220;Can Mandy come out and play?&#8221;
The look of pure joy on Mandy&#8217;s face was a dream come true.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original group of friends soon more than quadrupled in number. Now
Mandy&#8217;s classmates are the children who speak up and support her; they
are her advocates at school and in the playgrounds at home. These children
speak proudly of the joys and triumphs they have shared with Mandy, not
only at school but in the oommunity. Her classmates call on her to come
out to play; they are the friends who invite her to parties and dances
and who are anxious to see her at Brownies, gmnastics, figure skating and
baseball. These are the children who can&#8217;t wait to introduce me to their
parents as &#8220;Mandy&#8217;s Mom; Mandy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;she’s in our class&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integration is more than just education in school. It is a part of
everything we do. Mandy&#8217;s integration does not start and stop in school;
she is an active member of her community.
Besides belonging to the figure skating club and attending the summer
playground programs and gymnastics, Mandy was a Brownie for three years.
The Brownie leader admitted that when she first learned that Mandy had
enrolled in her pack she was scared. But she said that, once she got to
know Mandy, she realized, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything she can&#8217;t do. She&#8217;s not
a problem. We just love her and the kids all look for her on Wednesday
nights.&#8221; Recently, the leader was asked if she had any children with
special needs in her Brownie pack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She replied, &#8220;No&#8221;. The person asked,&#8220;Well don&#8217;t you have Mandy?&#8221; The
Brownie leader&#8217;s response was, &#8220;Yes, but she doesn&#8217;t have special needs.
She&#8217;s just Mandy.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integration has helped Mandy to see herself as part of the whole. Her
Grade 1 teacher told me that one day, during math class, Mandy suddenly
stood up and literally picked up her desk. She moved it from the last row
by the door to the front row in the middle of the classroom. At the beginning
of the period, the kids had been asked to move their desks into groups, but,
with good intentions, Mandy&#8217;s desk had been positioned so that she would
not have to move. As the teacher stood there speechless, a little boy at
the back of the class put up his hand and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be mad at Mandy,
she just feels left out.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We quickly realized what Mandy was trying to tell us through her actions.
In her own way she was showing us that although she was physically integrated
she still felt special or different, an outsider. The other kids recognized
this and spoke up on her behalf. Mandy&#8217;s desk remained in the middle of the
classrcom, in the front row, for the rest of the school year. The incident
also illustrates how Mandy&#8217;s participation has enhanced the other children&#8217;s
learning process, providing a creative, accepting, learning environment
for every child. In fact, all students have benefitted in many ways from
a unified school system in which all learning needs are readily addressed.
The supports and resources provided through integration, such as the methods
and resource teachers, teacher&#8217;s aides, peer tutors and cooperative learning
groups, are providing valuable assistance to all students in the classroom.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_way_of_life">A WAY OF LIFE</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mandy has been accepted and made to feel comfortable and welcome and that
she belongs in her neighbourhood and community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is now recognized as Mandy: a cute little girl with strengths and a
personality She has experienced real life situations; she is learning in
a setting that will prepare her for life in the community as a contributing
and participating adult. She is accepted regardless of her abilities or
disability by her peers, by those who will also someday be the adults in
her community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peoples&#8217; attitudes are changing; people are more knowledgeable, more
sensitive and more willing to accept children with differences into their
classrooms, lives and communities. This letter from the mother of one of
Mandy&#8217;s clamates shows just how much attitudes are changing:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a relatively new resident of New Brunswick I was at first sceptical
about integration. I was concerned that my child, who had previously been
in French immersion, would not receive the extra attention that she may
or may not have needed. My concerns were totally unfounded. My daughter
has not been set back in any way by integration; but she has been greatly
enriched, as has our whole family.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My daughters best friend is handicapped. They are in the same class and
are close neighbours as well. Morgan does not think of Mandy as handicapped.
She doesn&#8217;t treat Mandy any differently from any of her other friends,
and cannot understand why some people make a to-do about being Mandy&#8217;s
&#8220;special friend&#8221;. To Morgan, Mandy is special just because she is Mandy,
a loving, generous, funny little girl, her greatest friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My personal views on integration have greatly changed. I have watched two
little girls blossom together and I feel that wouldn&#8217;t have happened without
integration. My entire family has been enriched by getting to know a
&#8220;handicapped child&#8221;; in fact I sometimes wonder who is truly handicapped.
Mandy accepts us with all our limitations and narrow-mindedness and we
accept Mandy for what she is, a child who is funny, determined and, in
my view, extremely courageous. Integration can teach us all many valuable
lessons in accepting others&#8217; limitations without harming anyone&#8217;s academic
endeavours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the greatest gifts we can give our children is freedom from prejudice
of any kind. By shielding our &#8216;perfect&#8217; children we are not doing them any
favours; we are, in fact, doing them a grave injustice. Children are naturally
non-judgmental and I find it unforgivable to foist the unfair labels and
prejudgments of some adults onto the shoulders of children.</p>

<p>Looking back, I have no regrets as to the path we chose for Mandy. As
pioneers in our educational system and as advocates for the acceptance of
people with differences into communities, our pleasure and success came
in our relationship with our daughter. As parents we were only catalysts,
providing her with the opportunities to build and develop friendships at
school and in the community. Yet many times I asked myself, &#8220;What do I
really want for Mandy?&#8221; One day, as I looked out my front window, I knew.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There, as the wind whistled about and the first snow flurry of the year danced
in the air, two little girls sat with their jackets off. They knew that
they weren&#8217;t allowed to have their coats off but it was fun. As they laughed
and played on the lawn swing they tried to catch snowflakes on their tongues.
Suddenly, overwhelmed, tears began to stream down my face. I said out loud,
&#8220;_This is what it is really all about!_ This is the kind of life I want
for both my children. This is the future. A future where integration is
no longer an issue but a fact of life.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have learned never to &#8220;judge a book by its cover&#8221;. I have learned that
change is not easy and it does not happen over night. You have to make it
happen!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I look to the future I know there are still struggles ahead. But, for
Mandy and our family, because of integration, we&#8217;ll be able to rise to meet
these challenges with others in our community.</p>

<p>When I was five years old, I began attending a religious program for hancapped
children. My sister, Donna, was a volunteer teacher in the class I wanted
to read. My sister said she would teach me. Our friend Lorraine gave Donna
teaching supplies to help me read. Lorraine is a teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In September I started Mounthaven School. This was a school for children
who have a mental handicap. My brothers and sisters went to a different
school. At Christmas time, my parents went to my school for interviews with
my teachers. They told my teacher and my principal that my sister was teaching
me to read. The principal and my teacher told my parents that Donna should
not be teaching me to read. My parents believed the teacher and the principal.
They told Donna and me to stop. My parents did this because they loved me
and they didn&#8217;t want me to have problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was taught the same things as the other children in my class. I was taught
different things from what my brothers and sisters were taught at their
school. It made me feel miserable to be taught different things. It made
me feel that I could not do things for myself. It made me frustrated.
I felt bad about myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I felt I was different from my brothers and sisters and friends and cousins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vincent Massey was a senior school program for students who were sixteen
years old to twenty-one years old. Every student was handicapped. When I
went to Vincent Massey, I wanted to learn things that would help me get
a job and be part of the community. I wanted to learn to read, write, do
math, take care of children. I felt left out, frustrated and bored because
I wasn&#8217;t learning things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I went to school they didn&#8217;t teach me to read. They taught me yoga
and crafts. I was upset with the work training that I had to do. I had to
go to a park in winter to paint picnic tables. I had to pac potatoes. frnally,
I told my sister that I didn&#8217;t want to do that anymore. It was cold at the
park. The work was dirty. I had to come home dirty. I didn&#8217;t like it. My
sister talked to my parents and they told the teacher that I wasn&#8217;t to do
these things. My principal was mad at my sister. My brothers and sisters
didn&#8217;t have to do that thinks at their school. I didn&#8217;t feel I was being
respected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was bored at that school. I felt bad sometimes. I didn&#8217;t really have any
friends. I liked some of the kids I went to school with but I only saw them
at school. I didn&#8217;t do things with them on the weekend. We lived far from
each other and we needed support to get together. My friends were my brothers
and sisters and their friends and my relatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>About ten years ago, a friend of my family, Paul, said he would help me
to read. He taught me to read words from the sports page of the newspaper.
It was fun. When Paul was teaching me, I felt good about myself. I realized
I could learn to read. I made a decision to do something about it. My teacher
didn&#8217;t support me. They told my sister that she was not being fair to me.
They said I couldn&#8217;t read. They were wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I could change the school I went to I would change the subjects. I wouldn&#8217;t
want crafts. I would want reading and writing. I had cooking classes but
only watched the teacher. I would want to participate more. I would want
to learn how to use the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would like to do projekts with the other students to learn about things.
I would want to learn about geography&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;about countries and how to use
a map. I would like to learn spelling. I would like to learn other languages,
especially Italian. I would like to learn math. I did like gym but would
have liked to do team sports like basketball. I would like to have had recess
so I could meet friends. I would have liked to get to know other students
and to do things with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wish I could have given my opinion about what I wanted to learn. I would
have liked to have choices. I would want respect and to feel important.
I would want to go to school with my brothers and sisters and to learn
interesting things.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two and a half years alter I graduated from Vincent Massey, I was hired
as an Educational Assistant at the Separate School Board. There were many
good things and there were some problems. The teachers would get upset with
me because I did the wrong thing. I didn&#8217;t know that it was wrong. I could
not read the list of duties that the teachers gave me. I was embarrassed
to tell them that I couldn&#8217;t read. When they found out that I couldn&#8217;t read
they said I should not have my job. I did not feel good about myself.
I felt that I was different from the other staff. People didn&#8217;t always want
to help me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My sister and I talked about the situation. She asked me if I wanted to
learn. I said I definitely wanted to learn. My parents, my brothers and
my other sister weren&#8217;t sure that it was necessary. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t a god
idea, they thought.
They said if I needed reading skills for my job maybe I should quit my job.
I thought, &#8220;No way!&#8221; We looked for a course but everyone said they didn&#8217;t
have a program for &#8220;special needs&#8221; students. Finally, the adult program
at the Separate School Board said OK. I went to the adult literacy program
sponsored by the Hamilton Catholic School Board Adult Education Program.
I started in I986 and continue to go for two half-days per week.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donna hired a tutor to give me extra support for a while. It was great.
I was learning. I made a commitment to stay with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I Iove going to Sacred Heart. My teacher Barb and I have a routine. I make
a sentence and I say it in to a tape recorder. Barb then writes the sentence
and we work on each new word. I make my own dictionary with my new words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m doing so well that I now read in my church on Sundays. When my sister
Patty got married I asked her if I could read at her wedding. At first she
said no. A friend at church asked me to read on a special occasion. Another
friend told my sister that I did a good job. After that she asked me to
read at her wedding. My relatives said I did a good job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I do not have many problems at work. I can read my duties. I can go to P.D.
days and I can participate in what&#8217;s going on because I can read some of
the notes and I can write notes. I can now read books. I learn more now.
I can be more independent because I can read signs in the community. I can
help children to read I feel good about myself because I can do it. I love
learning to read. It inccreases my vocabulary and this helps me to express
my feelings and my thoughts better. I am President of People First in Hamilton.
I can now write my own agenda for the meetings and I can read letters from
other groups that come to me. I read these letters to my group. There are

practising.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Gordon L. Porter</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since 1985, schools in New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29 have been
using an inclusive approach to educate students with disabilities (Porter, 1986).
This has required a number of changes in policies and goals, organizational
structures, instructional strategies, and support mechanisms. However, the
single most significant change has been the redefinition of the school-based
special education teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this new position, we adopted the term methods and resource teacher
(M&amp;R teacher), from the Wellington County Separate School Board in Guelph,
Ontario (Forest, 1984). We have invested considerable effort in definig
the role and in training people for the position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers are primarily responsible for providing direct
and effective support to classroom teachers, with the goal of enabling <em>all</em>
students to be meaningfully included in learning activities in regular classrooms.
M&amp;R teachers have a secondary responsibility to &#8220;exceptional&#8221; students
who require individualized supports and services to participate in and benefit
from regular classroom instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main functions of the M&amp;R teachers are collaboration, liaison, program
development, monitoring, and professional development.
<a href="#_job_description_for_methods_and_resource_teacher">(See Job Description, page 151)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following description of the role is based on discussions and interviews
with M&amp;.R teachers, as well as observation and surveys. Gathered in the
period from 1988 to 1990, the descriptions, quotations and analysis come
from former special class teachers, resource room teachers and regular class
teachers. In their new role as M&amp;R teachers, they provide a view of school
integration that is firmly connected to actual experience. They have participated
the process of change and they share their insights into what works, what skills,
qualities and training are required to sustain such an effort, and what work
needs to he be done day-to-day basis in schools.</p>

<h4 id="_what_is_the_job_of_the_methods_and_resource_teacher">WHAT IS THE JOB OF THE METHODS AND RESOURCE TEACHER?</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_helping_teachers">Helping Teachers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask me for help?&#8221; the methods and resource teacher asked
the Grade 12 English teacher who was complaining about having no materials
for e student with a low reading level. Teaching has been described as a
&#8220;lonely profession&#8221;; the English teacher is, like many of his colleagues,
reluctant to ask for help, even when it is available. As integretion of
students with special needs proceeds, however, many teachers are beginning
to ask for help. As one M&amp;R teacher commented:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the classroom teachers are to get this student involved in the class,
they need help. I get materials together that the student can do in the
class, things the teacher can use with the student.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers basically respond to the needs of teachers, and, as with the
English instructor, they most frequently help with materials, particularly
for reading, language arts and math.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teachers are specific about what they want help with, while others
are puzzled by a student&#8217;s lack of success and want the M&amp;R teacher to help
determine why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second major area teachers want help with is classroom behaviour and
discipline. For example, a student may not pay attention in class and may
refuse to work or may refuse to work and disrupt classroom activities and
affect the learning of other students. In some cases the students have
severe behavioural disorders, which are expressed in temper tantrums, physical
and verbal abuse of classmates or teachers, or in self-abusive behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers are asking for help with students who just won&#8217;t do the work or
who are acting out. Sometimes you don’t know whether the student is having
an academic pnoblem because of his behavioural difficulty or whether he&#8217;s
a behaviour problem because he can&#8217;t do the academic work:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The behaviour problems that come to me are where a child is what you might
call a lazy student. He doesn&#8217;t get his work done. He&#8217;s disorganized, hyperactive.
Of course, with integration we aim get emotionally disturbed or behaviour
disordened kids. I work out a plan with the teacher to decide what behaviour
we&#8217;re going to target and how to deal with the behaviour.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers also need moral support. One M&amp;R teacher reports that teachers
just want to talk over their problems, discuss their ideas and get a second
opinion on what they&#8217;re doing. In most cases this is done informally, in
the hallway or in the staff room:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers want to talk about the child who isn&#8217;t moulding in with everyone
else. He or she is just not doing well. Sometimes the teacher just needs
to ask &#8220;why isn&#8217;t he getting it?&#8221; The teacher doesn&#8217;t understand the child&#8217;s
inconsistencies and wants to talk it over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[The teachers] need support. They want to know that what they&#8217;re doing is
right. Even teachers who have been at it a while were saying, at the first
of the year, &#8220;We don&#8217;t hnow how to handle [integration of students with
disabilities]. I&#8217;ve never had to deal with this before.&#8221; When I simply
out lined what the objective was for the student in the class they took
right off. It&#8217;s amazing. They&#8217;re doing it right and I just provide a lot
of positive reinforcement. For example, I tell them, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need my
help, you know what you&#8217;re doing a you&#8217;re doing a good job&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes teachers really need a practical suggestion, some little thing
that clicks for them. Sometimes it is related to the student and sometimes
to the teacher. Maybe it&#8217;s an adjustment of teaching style, and the suggestions
you make don&#8217;t fit their style. You have to know what their style of teaching
is to really reach them.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meetings! A lot of meetings! That&#8217;s part of the planning, of course. You
meet with parents, you meet with teachers, teacher&#8217;s aides and others.
You&#8217;d like to have more time to yourself, but you&#8217;re usually in meetings,
I find.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This typifies the role of a teacher acting as a consultant in a school.
The major actities identified by methods and resource teachers usually
involve partnership with other teachers. This includes extensive discussions
with the teacher about the student&#8217;s difficulty and needs, and content and
structure of the individual program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work of methods and resource teachers is highly varied, with requirements
changing all the time, and people relying on their assistance daily. For
these reasons, M&amp;R teachers reported, they have to be both flexible and
responsive so they can be available when the teacher needs support, which
means they must plan their time very carefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They have to be ready to listen to all problems, no matter how simple,
and give immediate assistance. At the same time they have to be prepared
to respond to the crises which arise in schools everyday:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to find ways of being there. Teachers don&#8217;t always like to arrange
meetings, but they like to drop in. Maybe you&#8217;re right in the middle of
something, but you have to make yourself available for them when they&#8217;re
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the methods and resource role you can plan a day, but very often you can
only get into a couple of things that you want todo. So you have to be on
your toes and be able to be versatile, to change your plans on the spot.
In the classroom it&#8217;s a much more organized day. You know exactly
what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher also helps the teacher initiate the integration program
for a particular student and get it started in the classroom. One former
M&amp;R teacher said:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had to make sure that the teacher had enough resources to work with.
Also, if teachers were having any difficulty, I would see how I could assist
them in making it easier for the child to participate in the classroom.
I had to be in the classrooms at times monitoring what was going on and the
way things were being handled&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;how the teacher and the student were adjusting
and if there were any difficulties.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A final activity that involves considerable time, particularly for M&amp;R teachers
working at the junior and senior high school levels, is actually planning
and coordinating the overall schedule of exceptional students. Students
with disabilities attending high school can find it particularly difficult
to have a focus for the day at school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The methods and resource teacher sees that the student&#8217;s schedule is well
planned and realistic and that the student&#8217;s progress is monitored carefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to assisting students in course selection, M&amp;R teachers work
closely with the guidance counsellor and administrative personnel. They
also coordinate community work programs; they find the sites and provide
training, supervision and monitoring of community placement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I find I have to get an overall picture of the student. It takes a lot of
time and you have to look at that student in many different areas to get
a true picture of what the problem could be, diagnose where the problem is.
Sometimes you think you know and then you get some more information which
changes the whole outlook.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewed identified several practical day to day tactics
to support the teacher. Some take over and teach the class, which permits
the teacher to do planning and curriculum development. A second M&amp;R teacher
can work with the classroom teacher for an extended period of time to plan
and prepare needed materials. &#8220;I know one teacher was having trouble completing
a couple of things for an exceptional child. I said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go in your classroom
for twenty minutes while you go and jot down your ideas. I&#8217;ll put your ideas
in the right order and work on them for you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers report that they prefer to modify and adapt existing curriculum
to come up with usable materials. Classroom teachers and students also seem
to prefer curriculum materials related to the regular instructional program.
As a result, much of the work of the M&amp;R teacher is to assist the classroom
teacher in adapting the content and vocabulary of materials so they can
be used by exeptional students:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most teachers feel much more at ease if we can take the regular program
and deal with that so that these kids can still be a part of the class.
They find it easier to cope that way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I always mob sure the teacher has input. The teacher looks through the
objectives with me and then I take away what we have agreed on. I always
type it up,then give it to them and ask them to look it over. If I&#8217;m modifying
the program, I do the modification that we&#8217;ve talked about and I always get
them to OK it before I go ahead. They&#8217;re the ones who tell me whether I&#8217;m

<h4 id="_what_is_needed_to_do_the_job">WHAT IS NEEDED TO DO THE JOB?</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_professional_background">Professional Background</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the people interviewed for this study had been regular class teachers
with more than ten years of experience each before becoming M&amp;R teachers.
These teachers were mainly recruited into the M&amp;R position while on staff
at the school in which they now work. They were selected for their suitability
for the job. Only a few had pre-service training in special education, although
a number of the others took special education courses after becoming M&amp;R
teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A handful of the teachers interviewed had been special class teachers,
specifically of students labelled &#8220;trainable mentally handicapped&#8221;. They
evolved into the M&amp;R role as the integration of these students proceeded
in the school system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the teachers felt that regular class teachers experience was essential,
and that M&amp;R teachers should be able to identify with the experience of
the regular teacher:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think experience as a regular class teacher is necessary. It would be
a mistake to bring somebody totally new into the job. The good thing about
having somebody who was a classroom teacher, especially from the same school
or district, is that teachers see you as another teacher. I think that&#8217;s
good. You&#8217;re more aware of what some of the problems are.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Training in special education would be good, but I think more than training
it would be [necessary to have] experience in working with kids and being
a classroom teacher. I have used a lot of things, techniques and so forth,
that I had done in the classroom, as guidelines. And I really feel that
has been of more value to me. There definitely has to be training, but more
of my ability to work with teachers has been because of my experience in
the classroom.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to past experience as regular teachers, the M&amp;R teachers interviewed
felt it was  extremely important to keep their hand in the classroom on
an ongoing basis. Most of them teach regular classes to complete their work
assignment or on a voluntary basis. They said it not only gives them credibility
and gains respect from their peers, but is personally rewarding as well:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[Some teachers] don&#8217;t consider M&amp;R teachers real teachers because we&#8217;re
not in the classroom. We&#8217;re not faced with the day-to-day struggle of the
classroom. I think that M&amp;R teachers need to keep a handle on the regular
classroom to know what&#8217;s going on.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One M&amp;R teacher, who was about to teach a regular class for the first time,
said:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This year I&#8217;m teaching a regular Grade 2 class. I wanted to experience what
it was like to teach in a regular class.
Otherwise, how can I give teachers advice on what they should be doing in
a classroom? I&#8217;ve never really taught twenty-seven or thirty kids all at
once before. How do I know how you can handle all those children plus make
provisions for a special needs student?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_personal_qualities">Personal Qualities</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What qualities should an M&amp;R teacher have? The overriding opinion is that
a person developing educational programs for students with special needs
in regular classrooms must be optimistic and have a positive approach,
particularly to their expectations of the student with a disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also necessary to have confidence that teachers inexperienced in
teaching students with special needs will respond to the challenge. Many
classroom teachers have been told for years that students with disabilities
require special instruction from special educators. That thinking is not
easily changed and calls for the M&amp;R teacher to be naturally optimist and
positive in difficult situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Persistence is essential. &#8220;You have to be willing to go the extra mile,
willing to spend a little bit of extra time, a little bit of extra energy
or effort to get ahead and do what has to be done. Longer hours, meetings
whenever the parent is available &#8230;&#8203; you have to be willing to dig for ideas
keep looking and reading.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers have to work with a large number of people: teachers, administrators,
consultants, and parents. The ability to work well with others and to handle
interpersonal relationships effectively is another important part of the
job. One teacher described this as &#8220;accepting people as they are and not
trying to change them entirely over to your way of doing things.&#8221; One teacher
observed that she had to learn to act calm and easy-going and to be open
to different styles of operating. Her work as a regular class teacher had
not prepared her for this and it required considerable adjustment. There
are many different personalities in a school, each reacting in their own
way to the suggestions made by the M&amp;R teacher. The need to balance these
considerations against the need to push for changes and new approaches for
the student makes the position difficult:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Diplomacy is the big one because you have to be a diplomat
with parents, you have to be a diplomat with the other
teachers and you have to be diplomatic in your services to
the child. You have to be very careful that you&#8217;re not treating
the child as something less than any of the other students in
the school. You have to be careful that you&#8217;re not looking down
on the disabilities of the student. You have to make sure that
parents know that this child is just as importent as any other
child in the school. You have to make sure that you&#8217;re making
your point clear and making the needs of the student clear to
the other teachers withou being a threat to them and their
secure environment in the classroom.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewed repeatedly stressed they need to
be innovative, flexible, creative and observant. &#8220;I get to know
the student by observing. Prior to an assessment, I go into the
classroom, and talk to them on the playground. I make a point
of being around them, watching their games.&#8221; &#8220;I never thought
I was, but I have to admit I find I&#8217;m getting more and more
creative as the year goes on. I&#8217;m not afraid to try something
different. I came up with ten ways for a teacher to plan a test
for a student. And they&#8217;re successful.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They emphasized the need for good problem solving skills, for the
ability to have insight into a specific situation and see what
was really critical to its resolution. They talked about the
need to be alert and aware and to think quickly:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are a person with a mind-set that this is the way it should
be and it&#8217;s the only way to do it, then you&#8217;re going to have a lot
of stress because if one strategy doesn&#8217;t work, you won&#8217;t know what
to do next. You have to be able to say, &#8220;I made a mistake and I
can&#8217;t change that, but I can go on and do something else and try
to make it better&#8221;. And I think it&#8217;s good if you can make other
people feel able to say, &#8220;Big deal! It didn&#8217;t work. We&#8217;ll do
something different.&#8221; The teacher has to be flexible as well.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This shows that the ability to keep things in perspective and come up with
practical approaches is essential. If suggestions made to teachers are too
ambitious, and require unrealistic approaches or changes in the classroom,
they&#8217;re unlikely to be implemented. In addition, the M&amp;R teacher must do
everything possible to see that new approaches get off to a good start in
the classroom. Throughout the process, they can count on criticism, complaints
and grumbling. One teacher said she felt she had to be tough and not &#8220;let
them make me the low man on the totem pole.&#8221; Others referred to &#8220;having
a thick skin&#8221; and &#8220;letting everything run off you like water off a duck.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important attributes is a genuine concern for the success
of students with special needs. This commitment is especially difftcult
because the M&amp;R teacher has an indirect influence on a student&#8217;s success,
meaning that they often see the credit for success attributed to someone
else. &#8220;You won&#8217;t be given credit. Don&#8217;t expect people to say, &#8216;Hey, good
job!&#8217; If there&#8217;s going to be glory, it&#8217;s going to be for the regular classroom
teacher.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_skills">Skills</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers must know the educational needs of students with disabilities.
In an integrated model this requires an understanding and appreciation of
the benefits that integrated instruction can bring to the child. This knowledge
provides the framework for judgments about the student&#8217;s program. You have
to have a knowledge of what integration is all about. You have to have a
value base and an understanding of what the goals are for the education
of a student with special needs.`"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Skills in formal and informal assessment and diagnostic procedures used
to determine a student&#8217;s needs and to develop IEPs are also important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, M&amp;R teachers need a thorough knowledge of the available
instructional materials and resources that can be utilized to the best
advantage in the student&#8217;s program. This makes a background in special
education useful. However, most of the teachers felt that these things
could be learned on the job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers need to be good at setting priorities and at organizing.
Materials have to be assembled and paperwork completed while monitoring
continues and new cases are picked up:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There has to be on underlying organization to what you&#8217;re doing and you
have to have a long range plan of what you expect in the next two or three
months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve learned that I have to be very organized. If I&#8217;m not, and I think this
is one of the problems I had last year, I just keep thinking there&#8217;s so
much I&#8217;ve got to do and I just have a sense of panic. This year I&#8217;ve learned
that I have to be organized, deal with what I think is most important and
work my way through. Sometimes I don&#8217;t get to the bottom of the list but
I&#8217;ve found being organized has helped me a lot.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers have different teaching styles and students have different learning
styles, meaning M&amp;R teachers need a thorough knowledge of alternate teaching
strategies in addition to the school curriculum. They must have a sense of
what approach is likely to be most successful with an individual teacher
or student. At the elementary level, knowledge in reading, language arts
and mathematics is considered the most important. At the junior and senior
high levels more attention is paid to course content in social studies,
sience and vocational subjects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_training">Training</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers generally said they thought personal and process skills that
underlie the work of the M&amp;Rteacher should be present when the position
is assumed. Organizational and interpersonal skills, as well as a sensitivity
to student&#8217;s needs and the determination to solve problems, are all things
that are difficult to teach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specific skills related to completing assessments, writing IEPs and developing
curriculum howledge are more easily acquired on the job. A commitment to
personal development and self-improvement is obviously a great advantage
to someone working as a methods and resource teacher:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve had some special education training, but everything else I&#8217;ve had to
learn on my own. I&#8217;ve had to learn how to integrate students, how to define
their needs and how to have their needs met. I&#8217;ve had to learn course curriculums
so that I can modify them. I&#8217;ve had to develop my own system of modification.
The best training is experience. That&#8217;s the only way. You don&#8217;t develop
an intuitive feeling about something unless you&#8217;ve had experience doing
it. I&#8217;ve learned most of what I do day-to-day on the job.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When school districts 28 and 29 instituted the position of M&amp;R teacher,
a normal training plan was developed. It included individual work with
teachers and half-day or full-day group training sessions held every other
week. Outside consultants have been used on occasion, but most of the training
has been carried out by district staff including the original methods and
resource teachers themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Training focuses on developing an understanding of the philosophy of an
integrated program and the role of the M&amp;R teacher in supporting the program.
Training in collaborative skills is particularly useful as these skills
are critical in establishing the right relationship with the classroom teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8220;Being a methods and resource teacher is different. We need traing on how
to be a collaborative consultent rather than the expert.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewd were in ongoing training every other week, which
they felt was important for developing a sense of continuity and follow-up,
for ideas on new materials and new methods, and &#8220;to provide occasions where
teachers can sound off to one another.&#8221; The ongoing sessions also help
keep the M&amp;R teachers&#8217; morale up and their commitment to carrying out their
job high. M&amp;R teachers often feel alone in their perspective and uncertain
about matters. Meeting with their peers to talk over the successes as well
as the frustrations of the job, and to develop a sense of team work among
themselves is beneficial:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The training sessions every other week oregreot. We&#8217;ve been airing a few
of our problems and deciding on how to go from there. We decide what we&#8217;d
like to see done and build from session to session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I really enjoy talking with the other methods and resource teachers. I think
that&#8217;s the most valuable thing &#8230;&#8203; to be able to talk things over and say,
&#8220;I do it this way&#8221;, or !&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried this and it works&#8221;. There are so
many more ideas [available].</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers at the high school level suggest that their needs are somewhat
unique because of the departmental organization of their schools. They feel
they need to meet with other M&amp;R teachers in high schools to share perspectives,
problems and solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the district training program now in its fifth year, districts 28
and 29 teachers feel the need for making adjustments. Each year there are
five or six people new to the position and the training they require is
quite different from training for more experienced teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They suggest the need for greater individualization of the training with
less emphasis on whole group activities and more use of small groups established
on the basis of specific need, such as those of high school teachers. Insight
into actual experience through hands-on practise is a major training need
identified by M&amp;R teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the teachers saw areas they needed to learn more about including curriculum,
instructional techniques and the needs of individual children. Some expressed
confidence in their knowledge of regular classroom organisation and teaching
methods but felt they need more skill in assessment, testing and development
of appropriate individual plans for students. Another area in which many
felt inadequate was the development of multi-level instructional techniques
for use in the regular class.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_strategies_for_the_collaborative_role">STRATEGIES FOR THE COLLABORATIVE ROLE</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers reported using a variety of strategies to
support regular class teachers while avoiding positioning themselves as
experts who provide easy answers to problems. They stressed the importance
of being seen as fellow-teachers and collaborators: &#8220;You can&#8217;t ask a teacher
to do anything you wouldn&#8217;t do yourself. You can&#8217;t be an expert. You have
to be one of them.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One strategy is to encourage the regular class teacher to take ownership
of both the problem and the plan to deal with it:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In September I thought I was going to do everything. I thought I was going
to be Miss Wonderful and do the programs for the teachers, be so much of
a help to them. Then I realized, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing all of this; they&#8217;re not
taking ownership; they&#8217;re thinking those kids are my problem.&#8221; So I had
to go back and re-adjust my way of doing things. I think it&#8217;s a lot better
now that I keep the role of the M&amp;R teacher focused on assisting and being
there to assist, but not doing everything.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher has to visit the classroom frequently to maintain contact
with the student and monitor the program. This may cause difficulty, as
some teachers are not comfortable having visitors in their classrooms on
a regular basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I make sure that anytime I go into classrooms I tell the teachers why I&#8217;m
there. I talk to them about the students and the programs and I&#8217;m very
careful not to say anything about what goes on in their classroom to anyone
else. You have to be discreet about it.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers emphasized the need to listen to teachers, especially to
their ideas about possible strategies to use in the classroom. M&amp;R teachers
can help them select what they think is the most appropriate strategie but
it is the teacher who must use it in the classroom:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I ask them what they think would work best. How do they think they can do
it? I get them to talk about it and frequently they will make more of a
commitment to the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest; I don&#8217;t often give them an answer, because I don&#8217;t have
the answers. I just listen to them and talk, and maybe offer a few suggestions
about things I did when I was in the classroom or things that I&#8217;ve heard
about. I might refer them to somebody else, but I don&#8217;t necessarily give
them an answer myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I ask them, &#8220;What have you tried? Do you have any ideas of something else
that you haven&#8217;t tried, that you&#8217;ve been thinking about that might work?&#8221;
And instead of me saying, &#8220;Try this&#8221;, we come up with a list together
of two or three strategies. I let the teacher choose one of them to try.
Often they&#8217;ll some back and say, &#8220;Look, I tried this particular one and
I think it&#8217;s going to work.&#8221;  So, in my view, you can&#8217;t shove it down
their throats.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several M&amp;R teachers mentioned using other faculty members to provide reinforcement
to teachers. One described a situation where the principal served in this
role:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have so make sure the teachers are given positive reinforcement for
what they&#8217;re doing. They&#8217;re just feeling their way and they need positive
reinforcement to keep going. I&#8217;ve gone to the principal and said, &#8220;This
Grade 5 teacher is doing a really fine job; why don&#8217;t you tell her that
I mentioned it to you.&#8221; And the teacher feels that pat on the back and
that they&#8217;re doing a good job; it gives them a little push to go on and
keep working at it.</p>

<p>With the many visits M&amp;R teachers make to various classrooms, they become
well informed as to each teacher&#8217;s strengths and where these strengths might
be useful in other classrooms. They can facilitate an interchange of ideas
and among staff, promoting cooperation among teachers:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you have to say, &#8220;What about Mrs. So and So next door? She taught
a unit like that last year. Have you considered talking to her, or would
it help if I talked to her and got back to you?&#8221; You really have to use
all the resources you can. You can&#8217;t come up with enough ideas all by yourself
even if you&#8217;re very, very experienced.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of group problem-solving through either formal problem-solving teams
<a href="#_chapter_12">(see Chapter 12)</a>
or more informal approaches was mentioned by several teachers.
In one particular small school, the M&amp;R teacher suggested that all seven
staff members act as a team. Now they frequently discuss problems and help
each other resolve them. The methods and resource teacher&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;who was new
to the profession&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;said:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that I&#8217;ve only been teaching a few years is, I think, in some ways
a help. I can say to the more experienced teachers, &#8220;Well, how would you
handle this problem?&#8221; It&#8217;s almost an internship where we&#8217;re constantly
exchanging ideas. There&#8217;s a lot of feedback. I&#8217;ve prevented the teachers
with an idea and had them say, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;ve done this for a couple of weeks
and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s working.&#8221; So we pitch in and try something else.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the high school and, to a lesser extent, the junior high, students typically
see a teacher for only one period, which creates problems in the consultation
process. Effective group meetings can be especially useful here:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did an assessment on a learning disabled student who moved into the district.
When we had the case conference all the teachers were together, except one,
and it was a very effective meeting. They were cooperative and everybody
now has a much better handle on this student.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attention to detail goes a long way in making the consulting role work.
For example, it helps to hold meetings at the teachers&#8217; convenience:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think you have to be a little more careful with the teacher who&#8217;s &#8220;bucking&#8221;.
I know that the little things count. If I wanted to meet with a teacher,
I would try to arrange a convenient time for that teacher. I would go so
far as to arrange the meeting in the smoking staff room if that&#8217;s what
they wanted and I&#8217;d make coffee ahead of time and have everything ready
so it was pleasant meeting.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most schools have two teachers working in the M&amp;R role. They rely heavily
on each other, sharing the trials and frustrations of the position. At several
schools where the M&amp;R teachers were interviewed, they divided the class
equally at each grade level. For example, in one school serving Grades 1 to 5,
each M&amp;R teacher took responsibility for two of the four classes at each
level. They said this keeps each teacher involved with the whole curriculum
of the school. It also permits them to work as a team on curriculum questions,
and substitute for each other if necessary. The teamwork includes frequent
discussion of perspectives on individual cases and appropriate instructional
strategies:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We share the work. That way we can talk back and forth and compare what
we&#8217;ve done with different students. Maybe something I&#8217;ve done would be useful
to her and vice versa. Teachers know which M&amp;R teacher they should go to,
but sometimes in an emergency they talk to whoever they meet. We take care
of it. We often discuss assessments. It&#8217;s nice to have that back up, someone
who can confirm what you see. It&#8217;s also great because we&#8217;re both familiar
with all the kids and there are times when we have to sit in on a meeting
for the other M&amp;R teacher.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some schools M&amp;R teachers work out of the same room and discuss things
on an informal basis. In other schools, they have formal meetings once a
week where they discuss problems or issues. This seems more prevalent at
the high school than at the elementary level. One of the high schools reported
formal meetings each week that are attended by the three teacher&#8217;s aides
as well as the two M&amp;R teachers. They feel this helps them discuss and resolv
student and scheduling problems and deal with organizational issues.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teacher&#8217;s aides play an important part in the integration of students with
disabilities. The M&amp;R teacher sets priorities and allocates the teacher&#8217;s
aide&#8217;s time, and also sees that the classroom teacher takes responsibility
for the teacher&#8217;s aide&#8217;s work in the classroom. The teacher&#8217;s aide must
not be seen strictly as a tutor for the student with disabilities, but as
someone to help in any number of ways to facilitate the general operation
of the classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher&#8217;s aide is responsible to the teacher,not to the M&amp;R teacher
while in the classroom. So it&#8217;s up to the teacher, once the program is
initiated, to make sure that the teacher&#8217;s aide knows what she wants her
to do.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers must include teacher&#8217;s aides in planning strategies for students.
Since teacher&#8217;s aides are in the classroom with the student, they often
have insights and information that can contribute to the problem-solving
task. At the high school level, teacher&#8217;s aides are used to support students
as they go to regular classes throughout the school. They also play a major
role in community access and employment programs for students with severe
disabilities. Teacher&#8217;s aides are most often the staff member to accompany
a student on work placements. In situations where there is only one M&amp;R
teacher in the school, the teacher&#8217;s aide is a source of moral support
for the teacher: &#8220;It helps a lot, having a teacher&#8217;s aide, because then
you&#8217;re not there all by yourself. At least you have somebody else there
who knows how hard you&#8217;re working.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_teamwork_with_parents">Teamwork with Parents</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers view parents in much the same way they do regular class teachers.
They recognize that parents are critical to students&#8217; success in school,
so they must cooperate with and involve parents. However, like teachers,
parents bring unique personalities and levels of expectation to the relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers emphasized the need to know the parents well and to develop
a positive working relationship. Home visits are considered important,
particularly for parents who do not come to scheduled appointments at school.
It is important to let the parents know exactly what is happening with their
child in school to share the success and also discuss the difficulties that
are being experienced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parents typically have contact with the same M&amp;R teacher over a number of
years, which may prevent parents from seeing that the classroom teacher
is responsible for the student&#8217;s program. Most of the M&amp;R teachers feel
that the special relationship they have with the parent is positive but are
concerned that the regular teacher and the parent develop a good relationship
based on confidence and trust. Among the strategies they use is to have
the regular teacher make the phone call to arrange a meeting and to have
the teacher chair the planning meetings. This shows that the teacher is in
charge of the child&#8217;s education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relationship between high school teachers and parents seems weaker
than at other levels. High school teachers usually instruct five or six
classes a day and their relationships with individual students is superficial
compared to elementary and junior high teachers. As a result, the sense
of responsibility for the child&#8217;s total program is not as developed. Making
the relationship even more difficult is the fact that many high school
teachers only contact parents when there is something wrong, such as when
the child isn&#8217;t attending school regularly or has had a serious behavioural
incident. As a result, the relationship is based on negative events and
can be adversarial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the high school level, the M&amp;R teacher assumes more responsibility for
the programs of students with more severe disabilities. This creates a problem
of transfer of identity:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m still the one that parents call. The regular teachers haven&#8217;t made any
effort to get in touch with the parent just to find out how they can work
with them. There should be a lot more, but I think it all ties to the fact
that the regular teachers still don&#8217;t see these kids as their responsibility.
Even the parents don&#8217;t see the regular classroom teacher as responsible.
They still see me because they&#8217;ve dealt with me for three or four years.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the difficulties, the value of parent participation in program
planning for students is most apparent. The parents&#8217; aspirations and visons
for the child&#8217;s future are important and need to be incorporated into the
overall program planning. Some schools ensure that parents are involve in
initial planning to the extent that their goals for the child are a basis
for the school program:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve had parents in for planning sessions and we get very beneficial information
from them. Parents have just provided us with so much information that has helped
in planning for the students. For example, they said their child likes to
do this or he really enjoys doing that. To get from the parents the things
that have occurred [at home] is very helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We discuss the programs with the parents. We ask them for suggestions, what
they would like and then we try to incorporate those suggestions as much
as we can into the program. We maintain close contact with parents. The
teachers maintain that contact as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_teamwork_with_the_principal">Teamwork with the Principal</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relationship between the M&amp;R teacher and the principal is crucial to
the success of integration and it must be supported and nurtured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers feel that principals must understand the role of the M&amp;R teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important contributions the principal can make is to present
and clearly define the role of the M&amp;R teacher to the members of the school
staff and communicate his or her support of the M&amp;R program. Principals
also need to be involved sufficiently to show ownership of integration efforts.
This will motivate other staff members to do the same:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The principal has to really know what is going on. He has to be behind it
and believe in the program. Because if you have little breakdowns you have
to have the support. You have to have the back up all the way down the line,
otherwise the system will fail.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This level of support is not always present, however. Some M&amp;R teachers
reported that they found principals treating the program with what might
be called benign neglect, out of either lack of confidence or lack of interest:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If [the principal] was interested, [in the prgram] it would help. But since
the beginning of the year there has been nothing said. If the principal
brought it up, teachers would see that he&#8217;s monitoring it. He could even
go into the classes where special needs students are and see how things
are going and ask the teachers for copies of the objectives. He could ask
the teachers how they&#8217;re doing with the program. It would be so much more
effective if he was [monitoring the programs].</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Principals have a strong influence on the efforts of the M&amp;R teacher and
can seriously undermine the program. With the principal&#8217;s positive support
and collaboration the M&amp;R teacher can act confidently to help teachers meet
student needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher also needs the principal to listen to his or her concerns
and take action when required. Issues of authority sometimes come up when
teachers are asked to collaborate with M&amp;R teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When collaboration is a problem, M&amp;R teachers need a good relationship with
the school pincipal to resolve a situation successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to being up-to-date on critical issues and informed as to planning
programs, principals must take the lead in identifying students and teachers
who need the support of the M&amp;R teacher:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had a situation where a student was placed in a classroom where the teacher
wasn&#8217;t really sold on the idea. The principal said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve really got to
make this situation work, because if it doesn&#8217;t, it will make it
difficult for all of us.&#8221; So the principal and I have gone out of our way
to make sure the program has been a successful experience for the teacher.
We&#8217;ve involved her in workshops and given her time out to prepare matirials.
We&#8217;ve supported her every way we can and it&#8217;s worked very well. The teacher
now believes that it is working and can see changes in the student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one instance, a teacher was having a lot of misgivings about having an
exceptional student in the room. She felt the support she had was going
to be taken away, and I had a hard time convincing her that she head to play
a part in meeting the needs of the student. She didn&#8217;t feel she could do
that, so I left it at that point. I didn&#8217;t feel it was my role to push it
with her any more. I talked to the principal and asked him to access the
situation from his point of view. In his regular classroom visitation, he
was able to get the same point across and after a few weeks
the teacher was coming to me and saying &#8220;I worked with him [the child]
today and it was great.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher can benefit from the advice and guidance of the school principal.
This does not mean blind support for everything the M&amp;R teacher does, but
a collaborative approach to problem-solving based on mutual respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher needs to have confidence that the principal expects
program decisions will be supportive of students and that teachers will act
to meet students&#8217; needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers reported that they often use informal means to update the principal.
They may drop into the principal&#8217;s office from time to time or have discussions
whenever they meet in the school. Others schedule formal meetings with the
principal, and in some cases the guidance counsellor, on a weakly basis.</p>

<h5 id="_out_of_classroom_instruction">Out-of-Classroom Instruction</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Very httle pull-out instruction is occurring in the schools of New Brunswick
districts 28 and 29, and M&amp;R teachers feel that very little out-of-class
instruction is required. Most of them do very little of it, only twenty
to thirty minutes a day, three or four days a week, according to the time-use
survey
<a href="#TUS-A1">(see Time-Use Survey A1: Major Activities of Methods and Resource Teachers)</a>
.
Only one teacher had a student out of regular class for longer&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;six-and-a-half
hours out of a twenty-five-hour instructional week. Instead, small group
instruction is often carried out in the regular classroom with the M&amp;R teacher
or teacher&#8217;s aide. Considerable use of peer-tutoring has lessened the need
for pull-out or cut-of-class instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual or small group instruction is most frequently needed for reading
and other areas of language arts, or when a student is being easily distracted.
Teachers described instances where the special needs student was distracting
other students from their work and was taken from the class for a short
period of time to get the behaviour under control before returning to the
classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Community-based instruction programs also involve time out of class. These
include community access activities like going to the library, the bank,
the post office, or going out to a restaurant with an adult. In most cases,
a teacher&#8217;s aide accompanies the student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Districts 28 and 29 policy discourages but does not prohibit pull-out instruction,
requiring that the pull-out occur after other alternatives have been tried.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even then it should be used only for compelling reasons necessary to meet
the child&#8217;s needs:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have nothing against a student leaving the classroom for a short period
of time to meet an individual need.
And that goes right through from the multiply handicapped to the most gifted
students in our schoola. Everybody has individual needs, and if we can meet
them by withdrawing the child from class, or giving them an alternative from
time to time, then there is nothing wrong with that. However, that&#8217;s only
the case if it doesn&#8217;t interfere with the child&#8217;s self-esteem. I think that
pull-out should be done cautiously and as little as is necessary.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individualized instruction in class is the alternative to the pull-out approach.
This may be done by the teacher, the teacher&#8217;s aide, or by the M&amp;R teacher
coming into the class:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At present, we haven&#8217;t had to use pull-out very much. But in essence, our
teacher&#8217;s aides have been ping into the class and providing individual
instruction. [They] don&#8217;t work with the child in a seperate group, but within
the classroom. And I think it should happen in the classroom, because then
the teacher realises what&#8217;s happening with the child and can have some input.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewed disagreed with the concept of out-of-class
instruction as a way of making students &#8220;ready&#8221; for regular classroom
instruction:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers talk about readiness, which I think is a myth. You don&#8217;t get ready
to learn something. You can advance children&#8217;s interest, by trying to get
them involved, but you don&#8217;t get somebody ready for something.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to start the person where they are. For example, getting a student
ready for Grade 5 math is ridiculous. [The teacher] should be thinking,
&#8220;What is it that I want these kids to learn and how can I bring them to
that point?&#8221; I guess what I&#8217;m really saying is: Grade 5 teachers are not
maching Grade 5 math, but they are teaching math to Grade 5 students. The
teacher has to decide who those students are and where they are in terms
of mathematics.</p>

<h4 id="_the_challenges_and_rewards">THE CHALLENGES AND REWARDS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The job of an M&amp;R teacher is challenging in many ways. first and foremost,
M&amp;R teachers feel they never have enough time to do everything that needs
to be done. Program planning, materials preparation and completing the paperwork
associated with IEPs and other documents interferes with their ability to
get into classrooms to observe and monitor student progress. M&amp;R teachers
recognize that they should spend several hours at a time in the classroom
but usually only find time to observe for ten minutes to a half hour. As
a result, most methods and resource teachers depend to a great extent on
the reports of teachers and feedback from teacher&#8217;s aides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers suggest that there are serious problems with
classroom teachers expecting too much of their students with disabilities.
M&amp;R teachers must work very hard to see that teachers have realistic expectations
and that students don&#8217;t experience frustration and failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While teachers&#8217; expectations tend to be too high, parents of students who
have spent a number of years in segregated settings often need encouragement
to have higher expectations for their children. M&amp;R teachers report that
the parents seem reluctant to take risks with their child&#8217;s placement, putting
tight limits on program alternatives. When there is a great gap between
the M&amp;R teacher&#8217;s judgement and the expectations of the classroom teachers
and parents, development of an appropriate instructional program becomm
very difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also difficult to establish integrated programs for students with
disabilities when teaching methods over-emphasize content and put little
emphasis on individual and group activity, particularly at junior and senior
high levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s not much of an emphasis on concrete learning. Instead there&#8217;s an
emphasis on sitting at the desk in rows and listening to the teacher, taking
the notes, being able to regurgitate the information. Teachers are getting
these kids ready for college or for technical school and don&#8217;t have time
for anybody else. Project work is limited. Teachers don&#8217;t like to vary from
the curriculum. They don&#8217;t like to see another way. They&#8217;re not looking at
what the student needs at this particular time I find it difficult to get
teachers to understand.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_challenge_of_working_with_teachers">The Challenge of Working with Teachers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The constant search for effective ways to work with regular classroom teachers
is one of the major challenges identified by methods and resource teachers.
One M&amp;R teacher explains that classroom teachers have &#8220;different personalities,
different knowledge and experience.&#8221; They tend to practice their
profession in isolation, developing their own approaches to instruction
for students with special needs. The M&amp;R teacher must find ways to work
as an effective collaborator and problem-solver with each individual teacher.
Classroom teachers must be specific about both the kind of help and level
of support they expect from the M&amp;R teacher. They must also provide the M&amp;R
teacher with feedback on the usefulness of strategies being used. Open
communication is necessary if the relationship is to work:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most difficult part is working with my peers: doing the battles; trying
to communicate with them; trying to make them feel secure and give them
confidence that they can do what they think they should do.
They often know what to do, but just don&#8217;t think they can.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who lack confidence in their ability to meet the needs of students
with disabilities are reluctant to take risks. They don&#8217;t want to be responsible
for a lack of success on the part of the student. As a consequence, many
teachers resist trying something new unless they are assured that it will be
successful. This causes a lack of opportunity for the student:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who haven&#8217;t been exposed to [special needs] students think that
everything they do should be successful. They don&#8217;t realize that at times
they have to learn from mistakes and they can&#8217;t always be certain that things
will turn out the way they want.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers frequently feel frustrated by the difference
between what they know is possible in classroom instruction and what actually
occurs. They are sometimes caught in an ethical dilemma when they become
aware of classroom practices that may be detrimental to individual students:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The methods and resource teacher is not in a position of authority. We are
trained in strategies for teaching students at different levels in the classroom.
But we don&#8217;t actually have any authority to tell teachers, &#8220;This is what
you must do.&#8221; We can&#8217;t mandate change. We can only suggest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[Teachers] will say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a god idea&#8221;, but unless you&#8217;re right there,
checking all the time, you can&#8217;t count on them doing it. I think things
just fall by the wayside and if you&#8217;re dealing with a number of different
students and a number of different teachers, it&#8217;s very easy to lose track.
I find that frustrating. You are privy a lot of information you have to
control over. You&#8217;re responsible for the kids; you know where the problem
is; but you can&#8217;t do an awful lot.</p>

<p>When asked to compare being a methods and resource teacher with regular
class teaching, most remarked that the biggest difference is that they now
work more with adults, and their involvement with students is indirect.
To some, this makes the job very different but others still see it as teaching
but redirected to adults. Another difference that teachers identify is the
much less structured work day they have as M&amp;R teachers. Some consider the
job more demanding and stressful than regular teaching. They feel a lot
more pressure from a variety of people as they try to meet all their responsibilities:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My day is more varied. It&#8217;s a lot more hectic. I deal with a lot more people
than I used to. I&#8217;m concerned that I&#8217;m performing up to snuff much more
than in the regular classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;re much more accountable for what you&#8217;re doing. I like that. I like working
under pressure, so I like the feeling of being more accountable. Nobody
ever checked to see what I was doing in the regular class, at least in the
first few years. I had two or three years to learn the ropes before anybody
started checking, so I never really felt that pressure. In this job I&#8217;m
just new at it, and I feel I&#8217;m much more accountable for what I&#8217;m doing.
People are checking more often because you&#8217;re dealing with more people.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, those interviewed said they see students differently as a methods
and resource teacher. Instead of seeing students as a group, they see students
much more as individuals. Several of the teachers said if they returned
to regular class teaching they would be more sensitive to individual differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number of the M&amp;R teachers said they miss the direct contact and special
relationships they had with students as classrom teachers.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integration is for everyone. For a while I wondered whether it was really
going to work for a few, but now I realize it is for everyone. It might not
be using the same methods or it might not be for the same time limits, but
you have to be open to that. You have to look at the student as an individual.
All students have a right schooling and having people be positive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;mind
you there a lots of problems. With anything new there are going to be problems&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but we&#8217;re conquering them one at a time. It&#8217;s great to see it working.
I had doubts when I first started.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this teacher has a very positive and optimistic view towards the
integration of students with disabilities, many teachers in districts 28
and 29 don&#8217;t share her enthusiasm. M&amp;R teachers report that most teachers
have accepted that integration is going to take place and that it is probably
in the child&#8217;s best interest. Many are apprehensive about what they are
expected to do with the student with special needs. Some teachers are concerned
that through classroom integration, the student will miss the benefits of
more individualized instruction. One M&amp;R teacher with experience teaching
a segregated class suggested that teachers &#8220;don&#8217;t understand that what
you do in a one-to-one situation is basically what would take place in the
regular classroom.&#8221; Some teachers continue to nurture the idea that the
movement towards integration might end:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are still people saying it&#8217;s a cycle &#8230;&#8203; that we&#8217;re going to do away
with all this integration. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a cycle. I think that things
are evolving. It may be true that next year we&#8217;ll do things a little
differently, but we will be improving on what we&#8217;re doing now.
We&#8217;re never really going to segregate those children and go back to the
system we had before. I think parents are too aware of the situation to let
it go back.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that teachers are reported to be more apprehensive about
students with severe disabilities than those with mild or moderate disabilities.
The development of positive attitudes toward all students, irrespective of
disability, should be a universal goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers are convinced that teachers need direct experience
with integation in order for attitudes to change. They need to get to know
the student and directly experience the benefits the student gets from integrated
education:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One teacher who has a special needs student was really nervous and very
uptight. Since it was his first year [with a student with challenging needs
in his class] he depended on me almost one hundred per cent during the months
of September and into October. But now he&#8217;is enjoying this student. He comes
to me probably two or three times a week to ask a question, but he&#8217;s taken
the student as one of his own and has done a lot more than I had even hoped.
Experience does make a difference. They have to have a year under their belts
before some of the fear is alleviated.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The acceptance of integration grows with experience, but it doesn&#8217;t eliminate
teachers&#8217; concerns about a number of very practical matters. One M&amp;R teacher
pointed out that teachers become more anxious and concerned about integration
as classes increase in size. Teachers are also concerned about having students
with severe behaviour problems in their classes. This includes students who
are physically aggressive towards other students or the teacher and those
who are selfabusive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They express concern about the effect students with distracfing or disrupting
behaviours have on other students and their ability to pay attention and
benefit from instruction. Again, however, direct experience seems to be
the key to a fear of the unknown. Ones the teacher gets to know the student
and begins to experience the success of integration, attitudes begin to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the M&amp;R teachers noted an interesting ambiguity between the way some
teachers talk about integration and the way they act. She suggests that
while some teachers still say they are opposed to it, their actions aren&#8217;t
consistent with their words:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though you hear them saying things against [integration], their actions
don&#8217;t support what they&#8217;re saying. I think people are still afraid of saying
in front of their peers, &#8220;Well, maybe it&#8217;s not such a bad thing.&#8221; They&#8217;ve
been saying that it&#8217;s so terrible for yeors and they can&#8217;t lose face and
say that may be their attitude has changed. There seems to be a thing about
it that once you select a side you have to stay with that side.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The attitudes of teachers in districts 28 and 29 have been changing for
the positive. One M&amp;R teacher surveyed the opinions of teachers in her
school about integration. She reported that twenty-four of the thirty teachers
responded and only two of the twenty-four teachers indicated they did not
think that students should he integrated. Although a few continued to have
negative attitudes about the integration process, twelve of the twenty-four
said that their attitudes had changed and nine of the twelve reported that
their attitudes were more positive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_sources_of_personal_satisfaction">Sources of Personal Satisfaction</h5>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was a time when I distrusted regular education. I would never have
allowed a child who had special needs to go into a regular shool system
bcause I thought it would kill them. But after seeing that it could work
and being part of it and seeing the change in the children, naturally I
had to change my attitude. I always believed in individualized education,
but I was&#8217;t sure that it was possible in the school system. But now I can
see&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I mean it stares me in the face everyday&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that schools can change,
that teacher practice can change.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This attitude is not unique. Many educators, are sceptical of the capacity
of regular school programs to accept and provide for special needs students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a new and optimistic view is not unique either. Most of the methods
and resource teachers feel very positive. They feel that integration is
working and that their role in support of regular class teachers is an
important element in making it work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rewards they receive are quite different than those experienced in the
regular classroom. M&amp;R teachers get satisfaction from facilitating the suceess
of others. They have to enjoy being advocates for students and their families.
They have to be challenged by the help they provide to teachers to find
alternate strategies for students:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of satisfaction from seeing the improvements in students,
when in September, I thought, &#8220;What are we going todo with this child?&#8221;
[I&#8217;ve had satisfaction from] seeing integration work, and the support of
staff and administration and students. We&#8217;ve had so many students who have
taken it upon themselves to make it work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[I enjoy] seeing the results! When you actually see a student progressing
you feel good about it because chances are that progress would not have
taken place unless there had been intervention of some kind and that&#8217;s when
you feel good.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you watch a student with special needs with friends around, going on
her own to the cafeteria, you feel good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the biggest thing that we&#8217;ve done, other than integretion, is to
make teachers aware of the fact that all children are not learning at grade
level, and that they have to teach them at their level and have them meet
with success at that level. A lot ofchildren are having their needs met,
[who] before would have just been pushed along or ignored. Teachers are
addressing the whole situation differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we&#8217;re really talking about is just good teaching practice anyway.
We&#8217;re not neally saying anything new to teachers. It&#8217;s just making them
re-think and look at what they&#8217;ve been doing all along. I think there&#8217;s a
tendency now for teachers to see every child as an individual rather than
have a mass of thirty kids. I think in a few years teachers won&#8217;t be as
reluctant to have multi-level instruction in the classroom as now. Everybody
doesn&#8217;t have to be learning the same material at the same time.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conclusion_2">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is clear that the recruitment and selection of appropriate candidates
is essential for the M&amp;R teacher concept to work. Special education training
would be a benefit, but regular classroom teaching experience is an essential
prerequisite. Teachers with successful teaching experience bring a background
and measure of credibility to the position that can&#8217;t be taught. Ongoing
training is necessary and teachers who have the potential should be recruited
and encouraged to switch to the M&amp;R teacher role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be accepted that not everyone who tries the position will find
the job suitable. Some teachers find it difficult to switch to a collaborative
consultant role. Others will find they miss the security of regular teaching
assignment and want to return to it. A reasonable agree of turnover should
be welcomed and can prove beneficial by bringing new people with new ideas
into the position. Experience shows that those who leave the position return
to the classrom with improved skills and an anhanced perspective on meeting
student&#8217;s individual needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers and principals in districts 28 and 29 indicated that they needed
more training and experience to understand the M&amp;R teacher role. This is
essential if M&amp;R teachers are to play their part in the process of inclusion.
For the program to work well teachers need to gain an understanding of the
value of school integration and their responsibility in carrying it out.
Direct experience with a student with a disability appears to be a critical
part of this process. Successful experiences must be shared and the idea
that integration is a fad or a cycle needs to be put to rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers identified a number of strategies they have found effective
in working with regular class teachers. It will be important to share that
information and develop additional approaches. Many principals also need
to be more involved in the program. Their participation, understanding and
support is critical. It&#8217;s clear that when principals take an interest and
show leadership they can give the program the credibility it takes to be
successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to consider the classroom practices that facilitate the
inclusion of students with disabilities. Instructional practices need to
change. The reliance on teacher-directed instruction and mastery of content
does not encourage participation by students with disabilities and it is
questionable how much it benefits other students. Progressive teaching methods
like multi-level instruction, cooperative learning, peer-tutoring, project
work and activity-based learning need to be promoted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Special educators need to ensure that the general effort to improve instruction
includes factors relevant to students with special needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will be necessary to advocate for sufficient resources to carry out an
inclusionary program. Class size has a definite effect on the ability of
teachers to meaningfully integrate students with special needs. A class with
twenty-five students including one with special needs is much more manageable
than one with thirty-four students. Ongoing training is required for both
regular teachers and M&amp;R teachers. A sufficient number of M&amp;R teachers need
to be provided as well as teacher&#8217;s aids and other consulting professionals.
Integration is not a way to reduce the cost of special education. It is a
way to enrich the quality of education for <em>all</em> students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s important that those responsible for the program resist being
dogmatic or defensive. They need to be open and receptive to constructive
suggestions to improve both the policy and practice of the model. New ideas
need to be incorporated into the plan as it goes along. The opinions of those
participating must be respected, and flexible responses developed to deal
with new situations. Integration must be seen as consistent with providing
better education to all students.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_time_use_by_methods_and_resource_teachers">TIME-USE BY METHODS AND RESOURCE TEACHERS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On several occasions we have had M&amp;R teachers track their use of time to
provide an objective look at their activities. This makes it possible to
monitor the degree to which day-to-day practice corresponds to the theoretical
model for their role. The most recent survey was completed in January 1990
during the fourth full year of an integrated school setting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Twenty-five methods and resource teachers completed a time-use log for two
consecutive teaching days. They recorded the maior activities they were
engaged in during fifteen-minute time segments throughout the work day.
Four major categories of activity emerged: 1) collaborative consultation;
2) teacher support; 3) instruction; and 4) other
<a href="#TUS-A1">(see chart A1)</a>
.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The category that took up the major portion of time&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;32.5 per cent&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;was
collaborative consultation. This involves collaborating with teachers, teacher&#8217;s
aides, other M&amp;R teachers, parents, the principal and consulting professionals
such as psychologists. Time spent monitoring in-class activities was also
considered a collaborative function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second major area is teacher support activities. This category included
areas like referral and assessment, planning, IEP development and the preparation
of materials for instruction. These activities took 24.7 per cent of the M&amp;R
teachers time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A third category, instruction-related tasks, totalled 27.9 per cent of the time.
This area was made up of three distinct activities: 1) occasions when the
M&amp;R teacher provided direct instruction to the whole class so the regular
teacher could work with the individual student or do program development
for a student; 2) individual or small group instruction in the regular classroom
in partnership with the regular teacher; and 3) pull-out instruction in
the resource room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fourth and final category of activity included all the other activities
teachers engage in such as professional development, meeting with students
or student groups, school duty, and a variety of other activities. This
area accounted for 14.9 per cent of the M&amp;R teachers time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Charts
<a href="#TUS-A2">[A2]</a>,
<a href="#TUS-A3">[A3]</a>,
<a href="#TUS-A4">[A4]</a> and
<a href="#TUS-A5">[A5]</a>
detail the use of time in each area. Most of the time M&amp;R teachers are actively
engaged in collaborative and supportive activities with other staff members,
students and parents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is interesting to note that only about 13 per cent of the M&amp;R teachers&#8217;
time was devoted to pull-out instruction. Special education teachers have
substantially changed the way they use their time over the past five years.
As resource teachers and special class teachers, they were providing direct
instruction in a segregated classroom or to a small group on a pull-out basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was an emphasis on special education teachers replacing regular classroom
teachers as the instructors of special nude children. In their new capacity
as M&amp;R teachers, they spend a majority of their time consulting with and
helping teachers rather than replacing them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In January 1988, interviews were held with thirteen teachers who have worked
as methods and resource teachers in New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29.
Two of the thirteen were working in other capacities during the 1987-88 school
year and reflected on their previous experiences. The interviews were held
in the school where the teachers are on staff, and lasted from forty-five
to ninety minutes. The interviews were taped and the resulting transcripts
provided the information base for the study.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The study was based on qualitative research methods and utilised an inductive
approach. The interviews were openended and the teachers were free to take
the discussion where they wished. However, the focus of the interview was
on their work as methods and resource teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten of the teachers completed a time-use log over two work days in the weeks
following the interview. They recorded their major activities for each
fifteen-minute time period while they were at school. These were used for
analysis of their actual work activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The information from the interviews and the time-use logs was used to generate
the research findings. Time-use logs were also completed by all methods and
resource teachers in 1989 and 1990. The results for 1990 are reported in
the charts A1 to A5. The analysis and synthesis involved extensive sorting
and organizing of the data to generate the themes that are described. The
findings are firmly &#8220;grounded&#8221; in the recorded views of the methods and
resource teachers.</p>

<h4 id="_the_legal_and_professional_development_of_integration">THE LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since 1986 and the passage of Bill 85, many school districts in New Brunswick
have integrated exceptional students in regular classrooms. However, integration
was in effect for a number of years in NewBrunswick prior to Bill 85 and,
as a result, teachers and principals developed ways to implement integration
and make it successful for their own situations. They drew on various sources
of expertise including workshops, books, articles, visitations, courses,
sharing sessions, and practical experiencies. Even before Bill 85, professional
development in integration ranged from visitations outside of New Brunswick
to individual consultations with teachers and administrators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1986 and 1988, a series of regional workshops on integration were sponsored
by the New Brunswick Department of Education. The series consisted of three
workshops in 1986, attended by 104 classroom teachers, methods and resource
teachers
<a href="#_chapter_8">(see Chapter 8)</a>
and school and district administrators; and four workshops in 1988 with 170
educators in attendance. The main purposes of these workshops were: 1) to
provide training to teachers; 2)to share experiences; and 3) to problem-solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the second series of regional workshops, a provincial meeting on
integration was held in March 1988. It was attended by fifty-five classroom
teachers, methods and resource teachers and school administrators from across
the province. The participants were selected for their experience in the integration
process; they could provide useful information to other educators working
towards integration. At this meeting the teachers and administrators shared
their experiences, discussed their needs and concerns, and helped one another
to solve specific problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At both the meeting and the workshops, people were asked what had been particularly
helpful to them in making integration work. In addition, similar information
was obtained from school administrators at a meeting of three districts held
in April 1990. The feedback has become useful as strategies and recommendations
for successful integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without a doubt, the school principal is one of the key persons in successful
integration. Educators who were asked for feedback said they realized the
importance of a positive school environment in making integration work.
They gave valuable recommendations for school administrators involved in
the integration process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_recommandations_for_school_administrators">RECOMMANDATIONS FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_make_a_commitment">Make a Commitment</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the principal is seen as the leader of the school, it is imperative
that the commitment to integration be reflected in the school administrator&#8217;s
behaviour. Principals who were interviewed about integration by the California
Research Institute (1989) said, "` &#8230;&#8203; building leadership (is) characterized
by &#8230;&#8203; unwavering commitment.`"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In New Brunswick, educators have indicated that the most progressive schools
are the ones with school administrators who have a commitment to integration.
One group of teachers stated, &#8220;The success of integration in these schools
is based on school administrators who planned, promoted, implemented and rewarded.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_overcome_fears_and_prejudices">Overcome Fears and Prejudices</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some school administrators, making a commitment to integration meant
overcoming fears and prejudices, and changing attitudes about students who
have special needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to better understand integration, it may be helpful for administrators
to spend time talking to parents, other principals, teachers, and friends
who have had experiences with exceptional students and who can help to allay
fears. Observing and meeting these students may help school administrators
to feel more comfortable and to know what to expect in different situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to changing their own attitudes, school administrators are responsible
for helping their staff to overcome</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They can do this by arranging for teachers to visit classes where students
are successfully integrated, to read articles and books, to view videos
on integration, and to talk to students, parents, principals and teachers
who have had experience with the integration proccess.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One administrator said he finally understood what integration was all about
after reading Don Little&#8217;s article, A Crime Against Childhood&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Uniform
Curriculum at a Uniform Rate: Mainstreaming Re-Examined and Redefined (1985).
A teacher said that after he saw CBC&#8217;s The Journal documentary, Different
but Equal, he had a better understanding of parents&#8217; reasons for wanting
integration. He indicated that he had been affected by this news story and
felt more motivated to make integration work. Even when school administrators
had no opportunity to personally prepare for integration, they said they
and their staff were still able to make a commitment. As one principal said,
&#8220;Even before our school district developed their integration policies and
practices, I knew it was the right thing to do and my staff supported me.&#8221;
Similarly, another educator stated, &#8220;For me, it meant just saying to myself
and others, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to try this and do my best!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_initiate_integration">Initiate Integration</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The educators involved in the provincial workshop could not agree on how
school administrators should first involve all their staff in the integration
process. Some principals thought that at first they should allow their staff
to volunteer to integrate an exceptional student into their classroom. Then
other teachers would have many opportunities for sharing, observing and in-service
training, and would become involved naturally. They felt this process would
allay initial teacher fears.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other principals thought that all teachers on staff should be responsible
for integrating students with special needs right from the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students would automatically be placed in their age-appropriate class and,
through direct experience and training, the teachers would become less fearful
and would change their attitudes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the most part, teachers felt that actually having an exceptional student
integrated in their class had changed their attitudes and provided new learning
experiences. As one teacher described it, &#8220;Integration is in-service, ongoing
learning from the exceptional child&#8221; Another teacher stated, &#8220;Integration
is a catalyst for other things; now I look at working with other kids, like
gifted and many others who are out of the mainstream in my class.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was agreement, however, that to ensure the full benefits of an integrated
program, the school administrator should be responsible for providing support
to the teacher. Initially this support might include release time for the
teacher to plan, consult and attend in-service training, and provisions for
helping the teacher directly in the classroom through a methods and resource
teacher, a teacher assistant, and student and parent volunteers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers with experience in integration wanted their colleagues to try an
integrated classroom and know that it was acceptable to make mistakes. Many
teachers felt that they learned through experience because their principals
had allowed them to try different ways of integrating students.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_allow_for_transitional_planning">Allow for Transitional Planning</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Planning the student&#8217;s transition from separate to integrated settings was
seen as an important strategy in the integration proccess. Planning should
begin before an exceptional student enters school or at the end of the previous
school year. Principal support and involvement help make transitional planning
run more smoothly and effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Release time should be arranged so teachers receiving an integrated student
have adequate time to observe, meet with the parents and current teachers,
and prepare for the student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, the current teachers need time to prepare the receiving teachers.
This may include observing the receiving teacher in the classroom environment,
meeting with him or her and following up on omervations and meetings once the
student has been in the receiving teacher&#8217;s class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This planning often becomes more crucial when a student is entering a new
school such as junior or senior high. The principals between the schools
need to facilitate scheduling times for these observations and meetings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_enhance_teacher_expectations_and_attitudes">Enhance Teacher Expectations and Attitudes</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, teachers said they needed to raise their expectations and
enhance their attitudes toward their exceptional students. This appeared
to be particularly true for teachers of high school students. In other cases,
classroom teachers had expectations that were too high, and consequently
became frustrated because their exceptional students were unable to perform
like the other students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When exceptional students do not perform at an expected level, the teachers
often feel they are not doing enough for them. To help alleviate confusion
and develop realistic expectations, teachers need to be involved right from
the beginning. Administrators should ensure that all classroom teachers are
involved in the initial planning sessions for integrating exceptional students.
Even though at the high school level this would involve many teachers, it
would help all teachers to know in advance what is expected of them and
their students. The initial meeting helps prevent teachers and students from
becoming overwhelmed and frustrated by vague and unclear expectations and
goals. Once the student is in the regular classroom, it may be helpful for
the principal, the classroom teacher, and the methods and resource teacher
to collaborate in answering the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Why is the student in the regular class?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will be expected of the student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will be expected of each teacher?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One teacher summed it up: &#8220;It was helpful this year when I was told by
others that it was alright to have different expectations for my special
needs students. Then I finally felt the pressure was off.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_prepare_all_teachers">Prepare All Teachers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many principals and teachers indicated that, in retrospect, it was the special
education teacher who had the most difficulty changing roles to accommodate
integration. The special education teacher in one school needed to &#8220;let go&#8221;
of the special education students and the self-contained classroom. One teacher,
who had an exceptional student in her special education class for eleven
years, said she &#8220;needed preparation and time to learn how to &#8216;let go&#8217;
and to trust other educators with her exceptional students.&#8221; There was an
obvious need for support in overcoming these apprehensions and it was recommended
that the principal be responsible for preparing school staff including the
special education teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most effective and beneficial ways to prepare staff is by providing
school-based training, which can be used to assess and address the needs
of individual teachers. It is also helpful to have articles, books and video
tapes available for staff to read and view. Sharing, problem-solving sessions,
and school and class visitations were also identified as useful means to
teach about integration and inclusion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_expand_resources">Expand Resources</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The educators recommended that the use of school resources be expanded when
integrating exceptional students and that school administrators be flexible
and creative in using school resources. For example, a teacher who uses
cooperative learniing strategies may lend a hand in integration along with
the methods and resource teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When integration is being initiated, a student may be placed in a Grade 8
class instead of a Grade 7 class because of particular Grade 8 students who
may be more supportive and helpful in including the student with special
needs. Initially, a teacher who is active in extracurricular activities
may feel more comfortable being responsible for including the student with
special needs in extracurricular activities rather than in classroom activities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_use_and_enhance_support_services">Use and Enhance Support Services</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teachers felt that school administrators should advocate at the school
board level for support personnel such as a methods and resource teachers
and para-professionals. They also indicated that the principal should organize
in-school support such as volunteer programs, peer support groups and resource
centres.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once principals have established a variety of support structures within
their schools,teachers may be more willing to accept assistance from other
staff, using in-school services more readily. Initially, many teachers felt
challenged by the experience of integration, assuming it was totally up to
them to make integration successful. They hesitated to ask for help and often
the school administrators and other staff members were not sure how to help
their colleagues. Over time and with the establishment of additional school
resources, these teachers realized they didn&#8217;t have to do it alone, and
there were other people available to help them solve problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers identified their principal most frequently as the person to listen
to them and occasionally teach their class to give them an extra period
for planning. The methods and resource teacher was also identified as a
source of this assistance, as well as an aid in adapting curriculum and providing
additional resource materials. Once classroom teachers realized that the
principal was working to provide additional supports for them, they were
more likely to ask for help and less inclined to feel like failures because
they <em>did</em> ask for that help.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_provide_time_for_visitations_and_observations">Provide Time for Visitations and Observations</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most educators felt that the school administrators should facilitate staff
visits to observe classes of teachers who have experience in integrating
exceptional students. The educators also indicated that it was important
for the school administrators to advocate at the district level for teacher
visitations. In addition, the principals should arrange the visitations and
be in direct contact with other principals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers said they gained a great deal of knowledge from these visits. They
also felt rewarded by their principal when they were given the opportunity
to visit on a school day and learn from their colleagues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One case involved two students with severe disabilities who were being educated
in a segregated class. The staff considered them to be too severely handicapped
to he integrated into regular classes. The principal wanted to have these
students participate in the regular class but knew his staff needed assurance
that this was possible and beneficial. He contacted a principal in another
school district where a student with similar needs was integrated in a Grade 6
class. Arrangements were made for two teachers to visit this school. By
visiting the Grade 6 class and meeting with the principal, classroom teacher,
and methods and resource teacher, the two visiting teachers were able to see
the possibilities for integration in their school. Upon their return, the
information gleaned from their visitation helped the principal and the teachers to
initiate the integration process for their two students.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_provide_scheduled_preparation_time">Provide Scheduled Preparation Time</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The methods and resource and classroom teachers were supportive of principals
who planned for and scheduled additional preparation time for them. This was
done in a variety of ways. For example, one principal developed an extensive
integration plan and presented it as a school project. She requested additional
supply teacher days for her staff so that the classroom and methods and resource
teachers could meet on a regular basis during the school day for planning and
preparing adaptive lessons and materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In another school, the principal first scheduled the integrated teachers
for physical education, art and music classes, and at the times they wanted.
One teacher in this school chose to have her art, music and physical education
back-to-back so she could have at least one long, uninterrupted preparation
period per week. Another teacher in this school requested her special classes
at the end of the day so she could continue her preparation right after school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In another school the principal allowed his staff to brainstorm for ideas
on giving extra preparation time to one teacher who had an exceptional student
integrated in her class. The teachers decided that their colleague would
be released from lunch and recess duty. The principal also taught this
teacher&#8217;s class one period every two weeks in order to provide time for
her to collaborate with the methods and resource teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The educators described another popular strategy. The administrators and
methods and resource teachers supply taught for a period while classroom
teachers used the time to plan or meet with their own methods and resource
teacher.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_meet_with_teachers">Meet with Teachers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teachers, both regular class, and methods and resource, agreed that
they felt well supported by principals who were available to meet with them
either on a regular basis or at their request. The teachers mainly needed
their principals to listen to them in an open-minded way, be a sounding
board for innovative ideas, support them and reward them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_share_experiences_and_problem_solve">Share Experiences and Problem Solve</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout the process of integration, sessions for sharing both successful
and unsuccessful experiences and for problem solving have helped educators
to make changes and experience the benefits of integration. Sharing successful
experiences may help to allay the fears of teachers and school administrators
who are new to integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Common concerns and unsuccessful situations may be discussed and analyzed
so that solutions can be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Principals should be responsible for providing a means for teachers to
share with each other. In some schools this was done informally at regularly
scheduled pot-luck breakfasts or lunches, and formally at staff meetings.
In fact, one principal typed all school announcements in a flyer and the
teachers were responsible for reading these before a staff meeting. Questions
about the announcements were answered at the staff meeting but reading them
in advance gave the staff more time to share integration experiences and
to problem solve.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_establish_school_based_teams">Establish School-Based Teams</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most beneficial aspects of integration is how it encourages and
allows school staff to problem solve collaboratively. In the past, teachers
were often left alone to solve problems that occurred in their classroom.
With the onset of integration, however, opportunities were established for
school staff to meet and develop a diversity of solutions to problems.
These problem-solving sessions or team meetings provide teachers and school
administrators with the opportunity to pick and choose solutions, and implement
ones that best meet their own needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While school-based problem-solving teams
<a href="#_chapter_12">(see Chapter 12)</a>
are a structured means for teachers and school administrators to share and
problem solve, teachers also collaborate informally. One district found
that sharing and problem-solving sessions did not have to be structured
but occurred naturally at lunch and recess breaks or even outside of school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teacher assistant teams (Chalfant, Pysh and Moultrie, 1979) and other types
of school-based planning teams (Thousand, Fox, Reid, Godek and Williams, 1986)
were recommended many times as helpful models for teachers involved in integration.
It was agreed that the team&#8217;s function varied depending on the needs of
school and staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most often team members have helped to solve particular dificulties that
arise in the classroom environment. At other times the team members have
helped teachers prepare for integrating exceptional students or have assisted
in establishing a student&#8217;s individual educational plan. Some administrators
stressed that during the formative years, the principal should act as chairperson
of the teacher assistant team (TAT). Once the TAT is running smoothly, the
principal should remain on the team but not necessarily as chairperson.
Many school administrators indicated that they had included as team members
teachers who had not been accepting of the integration process. They often
found that participation in the team process helped change these teachers&#8217;
attitudes and behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another factor emphasized by school administrators who had established TATs
in their schools was scheduling of team meetings. It was felt that, whenever
possible, team meetings should be scheduled during the school day rather
than before or after school. There was also agreement that reasonable time
limits be established and adhered to for these meetings. As one administrator
stated, &#8220;People appreciate knowing that the TAT session will end on time,
and usually are not opposed to staying after school if they have participated
in making the decision about the meeting time.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_increase_parent_involvement">Increase Parent Involvement</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many educators identified the parents of exceptional students as primary
sources of support in the integration process. All people agreed that effective
parent-teacher communication was an important component in making integration
work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to have a strong working relationship with parents, principals
should establish procedures to allow parents to be involved in their child&#8217;s
educational plan. Parents should be involved in decision making and they
should participate in the planning team. Parents should also be invited
to visit and observe the class, especially when there is a difference between
how the student is performing at school and at home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The McGill Action Planning System (Lusthaus and Forest, 1987) is an excellent
procedure for involving parents and allowing parent participation and decision
making. This system has bee used extensively throughout New Brunswick in
planning integrated programs for students with severe disabilities. School
administrators have also found the McGill Action Planning System useful
in helping resolve conflicts between parents and teachers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_increase_parent_community_communications">Increase Parent/Community Communications</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teachers and principals questioned said that school administrators should
be responsible for informing parents and the community about the school&#8217;s
integration philosophy and policy. In some districts, brochures were developed
to help inform parents about integration and student services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were a variety of suggestions on how to involve parents more in their
children&#8217;s school life. These included: an active Home and School Association;
periodic newsletters; and information meetings for parents and people in
the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was also suggested that school administrators take the initiative and
meet with parents before problems arise. For example, one principal had
heard that a parent of a non-disabled student was upset about the integration
process in her school. The principal immediately called that parent and
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you have some concerns about John&#8217;s placement in Mrs.
Ryders class. Could we set a time to meet and discuss your concerns?&#8221;
She met with the parent on the following day and listened to his concerns.
She then explained the reasons for integration and had the parent observe
his child&#8217;s class, which included the child with special needs. By the end
of the school day, the parent was satisfied and appeared to have a better
understanding of integration and the school&#8217;s philosophy and practices.
The school administrator, by acting immediately on a rumour, alleviated
a potentially harmful situation and cleaned up misunderstandings about
integration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_support_the_methods_and_resource_teacher">Support the Methods and Resource Teacher</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated previously, both the regular class and methods and resource teachers
need support from the school administrators in implementing integration.
Initially, the methods and resource teacher may have to assist the regular
class teacher in a variety of ways such as by providing more planning time
and consultation. In order that this be carried out effectively, the principal
should help with planning, organization and scheduling so that the classroom
teachers can be released for specific periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many principals said they have found it important to select methods and
resource teachers who are able to assume some leadership and to collaborate
effectively with staff and parents. Principals also tend to rely on the
expertise of their methods and resource teachers. As one principal stated,
however, &#8220;Even though I rely on my methods and resource teacher to provide
leadership in integrating our exceptional students, I feel it is my responsibility
to keep in close contact with her so that I can provide the necessary support.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_assign_teacher_assistants">Assign Teacher Assistants</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the outset of many integration programs, teacher assistants were often
assigned to individual exceptional students. As a result, the teacher assistants
often took on &#8220;ownership&#8221; of the exceptional students who were assigned
to them. Consequently, the classroom teachers&#8217; role in educating these exceptional
students diminished and the students became more and more isolated in the
regular class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to prevent this situation, the educators recommended that the teacher
assistant be assigned to the teacher rather than the student. The teacher
would then be responsible for making sure the teacher assistant helped the
class in a variety of ways and became an integral part of the class.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_reward_successes_and_promote_public_awareness">Reward Successes and Promote Public Awareness</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All people involved in the workshops stressed the importance of school
administrators rewarding effective teachers and sharing successes with school
board members, district office administrators, other educators, parents and
the community. For example, some schools made short videos showing how
exceptional students were integrated in their classes. Other schools, which
had volunteered to initiate integration projects,
allowed outside educators to visit and meet the teachers who were experienced
in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many principals requested that their teachers experienced in integration
be allowed to attend and make presentations at conferences and workshops.
One teacher said. &#8220;I realised my year was successful when my principal asked
me to share my experiences with other teachers in the school. His request was
a real compliment.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conclusion_3">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the past few years, more and more educators have gained experience in
integrating exceptional students in regular classes. Many strategies have
been developed and have helped educators initiate integration and make the
process successful (Biklen, 1985; Sailor, Anderson, Halvorsen, Doering, Filler
and Goetz, 1989; Stainbeck and Stainback, 1989).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In New Brunswick, workshops have been held with educators experienced in
integration to identify and discuss what has helped them. Over the course
of these workshops, it was found that what was effective for one educator
may not have worked for another. Therefore, many strategies have been presented
here and more than one may be implemented to assist staff in a particular
school or school district.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Margaret Murray</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other than being a parent, I cannot think of a position in which a person
wears as many hats as that of a teacher. Not only are the roles of the teacher
numerous and varied, but a teacher must switch from one to another spontaneously,
smoothly and professionally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The inclusion of students with a mental handicap in a regular classroom
does not, in my opinion, create new roles for the teacher. It does, however,
require a honing of existing skills, and a reassessment of traditional
practices and attitudes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary role of a teacher is, as always, to teach; but integration
broadens the focus to include an examination of what we are really teaching,
in the general sense, and how we are teaching it. This broadening of vision
is challenging, frightening and exciting, all at the same time. The combination
of such strong emotional forces should jolt us out of our complacency, out
of the secure niche we have made for ourselves. If all the support systems
are in place and the teacher&#8217;s focus is positive, teachers and students alike
grow and benefit from the experience. The secondary role of the teacher,
therefore, is to respond professionally to the challenge, fear, and
excitement of teaching all children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will examine some approaches to that response. I am confident that as
teachers read they will frequently say, &#8220;I am doing that in my classroom
already&#8221;, or at the very least,&#8220;I can do that&#8221;. And administrators will
feel that they have teachers on staff who fulfil the requirements capability.
This is because the similarities between teaching a regular class and an
integrated class far outnumber the differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will examine the role of the teacher from four perspectives. The first
deals with the teacher as a person and as a professional. The second addresses
the teacher operating in many capacities in the classroom. The third focuses
on the specific relationship between the teacher and the exceptional student
in his or her class. Finally, we have a look at the highly collaborative
nature of the classroom teacher-support system liaison.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_teacher_personally_and_professionally">THE TEACHER: PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Strategies in Preparation</em></strong><br>
Teaching an integrated class requires a personal as well as a professional
commitment. It is not enough for the school board, the superintendent and
the school administration to support the philosophy of integration. The
actual success or failure of integration hinges on the classroom teacher&#8217;s
beliefs and practices. In fact, the strongest indicator that integration
will be successful is the degree to which the classroom teacher believes
in the idea. The teacher must believe that the school is the most natural
setting for students to grow and learn from each other and from educated
adults.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most common remarks teachers make when facing integration i
that they are not ready for it. They say there is too much they do not
know and they feel ill-prepared.
These are real concerns and should be acknowledged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it seems to be the human condition that few of us are
prepared for the major challanges in life, such as marriage, parenthood,
or career changes. While I think it is important to recognice the challenge
of an integrated classroom, I believe it is equally important to embrace
integration with optimism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, preparation does not necessarily mean textbook knowledge of
various physical and mental conditions. Preparation may simply consist of
studying the student&#8217;s individual education program the time he or she
entered the school system. It helps put things in perspective to see where
the student was at the beginning of his or her education and what growth
has occurred over the years. It relieves teachers from feeling that they
have complete responsibility for the future success of the student and it
gives teachers reassurance to see themselves as part of a team. Further
preparation would involve discussions with parents to strengthen understanding
of potential goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avoid lists of things the student can and cannot do. They can be both
discouraging to the teacher and damaging to your creative vision. Children
who have a mental handicap can be handicapped by our perception of their
limitations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important part of preparation is to meet and get to know the child.
No matter what physical or mental challenges the child presents, he or she
has the some basic needs as all other students&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the need for understanding
and respect, the need to be listened to and appreciated, and the need to learn
in his or her own style. If teachers address these needs competently, everything
will fall into place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Creative Freedom</em></strong><br>
When teaching in an integrated setting, teachers should permit themselves
some creative freedom. When teachers first begin their careers, they are
daring, trying new ideas, making mistakes, revelling in their successes.
Unfortunately, creativity is an early casualty in many classrooms, not by
design or intent but by a slow and quiet process as teachers slip into
comfortable routines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because a child&#8217;s special needs may be beyonds teacher&#8217;s experience, we
are forced to throw out some of our traditional methods and find innovative
approaches. What we discover is that all our students benefit from this
change in practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One year I was assigned to teach french to a class which included a blind
student. Although it was a language course, the lessons included a lot of
visual stimuli. In order for the blind student to participate and be involved,
the language had to come alive, which we achieved by physically acting out
situations. The students loved not having to sit at their desks doing board
work. The results were so much better that I used the same approach in another
French class I taught which did not include anyone with special needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the years I have had students with a wide range of needs. They have
opened my eyes to countless new ways of doing things. And because of this
creative freedom, I have realized that the child&#8217;s learning process is every
bit as important as what he or she learns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Common Objectives</em></strong><br>
For many children with special needs, the regular academic objectives are
not appropriate. Programs need to be modified, with much more emphasis
placed on helping students to develop into functional, contributing members
of their community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers should have a vision of the desired results and avoid confining
themselves to a list of objectives for a particular grade level. Everything
a teacher plans for the student should fit into the vision the teacher and
the parents, and, in many cases, the student have for his or her future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Collaboration</em></strong><br>
Because teachers often view having a student with special needs as a big
responsibility, it is wise to embrace the collaborative spirit. Collaboration
with other school staff members is an extremely intelligent approach with
far ranging benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is true that an open-door policy is often threatening to teachers
trying new strategies to meet the needs of their integrated student, itis
equally true that two heads are better then one. An observer, such as another
staff member, can often shed light on factors in the classroom environment
which may be influencing the way a student is learning or behaving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integrated classroom teachers also have the right to be demanding. They
should ask for release time to attend workshops or to visit classrooms or
schools. They should request parent volunteers and aides. In some cases
extra preparation time is allotted or smaller class sizes given to teachers
who work in an integrated classroom. Administration should be made aware
that teachers need their support in the way of special resources and additional
support people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strategies outlined above are practised in classrroomsevery day. They are not
particular to an integrated classroom but are found wherever students and
teachers enjoy learning together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_teacher_and_the_classroom">THE TEACHER AND THE CLASSROOM</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has always been a characteristic of education that there has never
been enough time to get everything done. Today, even with advanced technology
surrounding us, it seems that more and more activities are cutting into our
precious minutes.
Each child needs time with the teacher, and teachers make conscious efforts
to interact with each student every day. But we never feel that we have
spent enough time with each student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feelinq only increases when the class includes a child with spedal
needs. Because of their needs, they generally require even more one-on-one
attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Strategies for One-on-One Attention</em></strong><br>
The following strategies call on various resources and tactics to
enable the teacher to focus more  time on each student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first resource is the para-professionals in the education system:
teacher&#8217;s aides, assistants, and trained volunteers. The teacher can
ask this other adult to handle the class, which may be working on an
assignment prepared by the teacher, while the teacher works with an
individual student.
Or the teacher may ask the aide to work with the individual student
on a task again prepared by the teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second source of help is the children themselves. It is a wise
teacher who realizes he or she is not the only instructor in the
classroom. Peer tutoring is a growing practice not only within a
class but across grade levels as well. One of the wonderful things
about children is that they do not see the limitations of other
children. They are compassionate and passionate at the same time. The
most umnotivated student turns into a zealot when asked to help
another student. A word of caution: monitor the tutoring so that
the time spent is meaningful to both parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another strategy is to design activities for the whole class which
free the teacher for short blocks of time to work with an individual
student. Again, the activity should he worthwhile for students, but
one which requires only minimal interaction with the teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fourth strategy is parental support. It is important to choose
parents who have a strong commitment to their involvement. Working
with small groups in the classroom, a parent can add a warm and
caring touch that all children enjoy and many children need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Creating a Community Atmosphere</em></strong><br>
To work well, a class has to be a cohesive unit which pulls together
for the benefit of all students. It is the teacher&#8217;s responsibility
to promote a feeling of community and an appreciation of the
differences which make up that community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an increasingly challenging role as children from different backgrounds
are bought together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, the teachar is forced to become a social coordinator, creating
a cooperative rather than a competitive environment by designing activities,
both academic and social, which support cooperative values. Since social
development is critical to successful functioning within a community, the
teacher&#8217;s role as coordinator is important to all students in the class.
Individual children are not lost in the cooperative structure; instead,
they are shown that they each have something to offer which is of equal
value to everyone else&#8217;s contribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a classroom which includes a child with a mental handicap, the teacher
includes this child in most activities and quietly encourages interaction
without drawing special attention to it. The other children soon assume
responsibility for any extra needs the child might have. It has been my
experience that they develop strong bonds with the child and may need only
to he cautioned against doing too much for him or her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monitoring the social development of all students provides teachers with
opportunities to assess the growth and maturing of individual students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Motivation</em></strong><br>
In a classroom where teachers need time to work closely with children with
special needs, the teachers need to be motivators. They must encourage
students to do their best, think problems through and develop self-discipline.
This develops independence and permits the teacher to have quality time
with an individual student without having to continually break away to quiet
or direct the other students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From my observation, smoothly running classrooms have teachers who are
motivators. They have regular dicussions with their students on the benefits
of sharing ideas, on problem solving techniques, and on responsibility.
These discussions are ongoing and are rarely reactive in nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often in these classrooms there is greater freedom of movement and a mutually
agreed upon noise level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of providing motivation includes designing activities which children
find interesting and challenging. As in any classroom, this requires
activities covering a wide range of abilities. Cooperative activities and
learning centres lend themselves well to multi-level lesson plans
<a href="#_chapter_11">(see Chapter 11)</a>
.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The physical layout of the classroom can also be structured to promote
independence. All materials are organized and visible. Instructions for
centres and activities are posted. Specific places for completed assignments
are established, as are produceres for leaving the classroom, late arrivals,
and free time. At all times, students know what they me supposed to be doing.
While the teacher is responsible for designing, initiating and monitoring all
activities, everyone benefits as students become more independent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Providing Role Models</em></strong><br>
Probably one of the most important roles a teacher can play in an integrated
classroom is that of a model for his or her students. The teacher should
treat every member of the class with equal respect and show that he or she
values every student, including the special needs child.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach may feel unnatural, however, as teachers are in the business
of teaching, and are in the habit of constantly rewarding those who learn
well. It is understandable to have more respect for successful students and
to pay more attention to their ideas. In an integrated setting, however,
these teacher distinctions can be detrimental. Less successful students will
find someone who they consider to he worse off than themselves to bear the
brunt of their frustration&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and that may well be the student with a mental
handicap. As mentioned earlier, a sense of community is needed in the
classroom, and the teacher models the way community members should treat
each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher should include all children and make no exceptions, showing
that everyone is valued and accepted. At assemblies, plays, concerts or
sports days, the teacher should insist that all students are included. The
pupil who has a mental handicap should be included in activities in the
cafeteria and library, and in fire drills or on field trips. By modelling
normal interaction and promoting it in the classroom, the teacher gives
students something they will carry into their adult lives in the ommunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Learning Through Observation</em></strong><br>
It is now a common belief that teachers learn as much about their students
through observation as through formal testing. The teacher can use keen
observation in an integrated classroom to prevent problems. In a class
including students with behavioural problems, the cooperative spirit will
take a while to build. In any class there will be bullies and people who
make fun of others. Through careful observation by the teacher, negative
situations can be minimized and the teacher can develop strategies which
allow everyone to be more comfortable in the classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some interactions may seem harmless in the eyes of the instigators&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;like
teaching the child with a mental handicap to say &#8220;bad&#8221; words. But, since
the long term goal is to help this child develop into a social member of
a community, setbacks are not appreciated. Students must be educated to
understand this. Observant teachers will also pick up on things they can
work on to help the child socialize: table manners, conduct when eating,
personal hygiene.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher&#8217;s role in the classroom stretches well beyond the narrow limits
of &#8220;instructor&#8221; to include: time manager, social coordinator, motivator,
model, observer and more. Again, most teachers will have read much here
that is familiar to their daily routine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_teacher_and_the_student_with_a_disability">THE TEACHER AND THE STUDENT WITH A DISABILITY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Multi-Level Instruction</em></strong><br>
While each member of the class should be treated equally and given the
same rights and value, equality must not be confused with sameness. All
students in the class are indivdual and have needs different from each
other. Individualization within the class should be built in as much as
possible. We must acknowledge that students do not learn at the same rate
or in the same way, and we should be equally aware that one set of goals
is not appropriate for all students. As logical as this sounds, it is
sometimes difficult for teachers to accept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most useful strategies for the classroom teacher is to design
lessons which permit multi-level participation
<a href="#_chapter_11">(see Chapter 11)</a>
.
This means, for example, that while some students are reading a novel,
the child with a visual impairment is listening to a taped version of the
novel, while other students with lower reading vocabularies have access
to a modified version or a peer reader. It means that while one student
prepares a written report, another prepares a report orally or with
pictures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-level instruction promotes the use of questions designed to address
all of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy (Bloom,1969)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;levels of cognitive difficulty
developed by Benjamin Bloom, a psychologist and educational theorist at
the University of Chicago
<a href="#BloomPage">(see Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy)</a>
.
Therefore questions will reach children at different levels of understanding.
Similarly, many learning tools, including computers, calculators and
recorders, are encouraged and accepted so that all children can be
involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Life Experiences</em></strong><br>
Providing meaningful experiences is one of the most interesting aspects
of teaching children with special needs. Because many of the students I
have worked with have had limited understanding of their world, it is
essential to create situations which bring them greater knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may involve bringing pets to school, cooking, dressing up in costumes,
working with utensils or taking nature walks. For older students, it may
be visits to businesses and places outside the school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important not to isolate the student from his peers during these
experiences. Involve the whole class or small groups, depanding on the
situation. Because children learn terrific lessons from other children,
minimize the teacher&#8217;s role and maximize the students&#8217; during these
activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Highlight Strengths</em></strong><br>
Teachers can also create situations which highlight the strengths of the
student with a disability. Everyone has strengths; and it is interesting
that children view achievement with equal admiration regardless of who is
the achiever. I remember watching some young children being tutored in
reading by a blind student who was reading braille. These youngsters where
genuinely impressed, but not because this student could read&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they expected
older kids to be able to read. They were impressed because she had a special
skill and could decode dots with her fingertips. That was &#8220;cool!&#8221; A child
who had been labelled autistic had an uncanny mathematical memory and was
regarded with some degree of awe by his classmates. During math competitions,
he was always in demand as a teammate. A student with a mental handicap was
a terrific runner and during sports day he was cheered vigorously and
genuinely by his classmates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we may design activities which will allow the strengths of our
students with disabilities to shine, we must be cautious that they are
not artificial. We are not trying to spotlight the child, we only want to
build in activities that will allow him or her to experience success and
receive the admiration of classmates. As teachers, we know the importance
of building self-esteem; the link between high self-esteem and success is
the same for all students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More often than not, children will create their own moment in the sun.
Unintentionally and unexpectedly, they will do something, and other students
will take notice. Perhaps my favourite memory of just such a moment is of
a Grade 3 French class. Every day I wrote the date in French in a sentence
on the board. We would repeat it a few times and move on to something else.
One student, who had been labelled autistic, usually spent five or six minutes
laboriously copying the sentence into his notebook.  He was never asked to,
nor did any of the other children copy the sentence. It was just something
that he had decided to do. This went on for several months. One day in early
spring; I was late putting the date on the board because a little girl met
me at the door and wanted to tell me about her birthday. I looked into the
classroom to see every eye staring at the board. I was amazed to see this
little boy finishing the date sentence. He had written it in French by himself,
unaided. It was letter perfect. We were collectively impressed. Several
students spontaneously went over to him and told him what a great job he
had done. Their praise came not only because he had done it but also because
they knew that they could not! After that, several children wanted to try
writing the date and eventually some of them succeeded. That is the kind
of situation teachers wish for regularly&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;where one student teaches others
something worthwhile! Teachers should allow themselves the flexibility to
capitalize on these moments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Developing Independence</em></strong><br>
The teacher must also concentrate on developing independence in the child
with a disability. All students need to be independent, but for a child
with a disability, it is one of the most important and intensely difficult
things the teacher will help that student achieve. The struggle is long
and gains are often made in small steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some members of my class worked with a student to help him walk home from
school. He does not live far from the school but he had never walked anywhere
by himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For several months they walked behind him, prompting him when necessary
to stay on the sidewalk or to stop at the sign or keep walking. Progress
was slow but they continually came closer to their goal. Another child was
learning to use his wheel chair, and yet another to manoeuvre her way to
various parts of the school although she is totally blind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other students are dedicated helpers in this fight for independence. Young
children do not see disabilities in the same light that adults do. We
tend to be overwhelmed by the disability and the obstacles it creats.
Children just see the moment and they do whatever has to be done to fix
things for that moment. Watch them interacting: directing, encouraging,
helping or just plain nagging, "`will you hurry up!"` Another interesting
reason for including other children in efforts to reach goals is that
children will do things for other children that they will do less willingly
for an adult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Teacher as Supporter</em></strong><br>
Each child with special needs who I have worked with has inadvertently
defined a special role for me: the role of supporter. As classroom
teachers, we need to be the supporter of our children, to be there for
them, to listen to their concerns and to understand them. No one needs
this more than children with disabilities. Their teachers must be
available to explain to other educators their strengths, learning styles,
and goals, to tell who their friends are and to suggest strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher does not need to be an expert or have all the answers for the
child. But it should be clear that the teacher supports this child and
will do whatever he or she can do to help; it should also be clear that
the teacher appreciates the support of others. Interestingly enough, when
we actually ask for help, we often get it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who have integrated classrooms design lessons which include all
students according to their learning styles. They include activities
which will build on the strengths of their students.
They strive to give their students the tools for</p>

<h4 id="_the_teacher_and_the_support_system">THE TEACHER AND THE SUPPORT SYSTEM</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Methods and Resource Teachers</em></strong>
No matter how experienced, enthusiastic or determined teachers might be,
they will find their roles easier if there is someone to help. Methods and
resource (M&amp;R) teachers
<a href="#_chapter_8">(see Chapter 8)</a>
are, first and foremost, experienced classroom teachers who have received
additional training in areas such as student assessment, Individual Education
Plans (IEPs) and multilevel instruction. They provide the teachers with
assistance in: assessment, planning, instruction and evaluation for students
with special program needs. An important working relationship exists between
the classroom teacher and the methods and resource teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> A student with special needs is usually identified upon
entry into the school system, and, as that student moves through the system,
his or her file is updated frequently. If new problems or circumstances
arise, the teacher gathers information on the child and consults with the
M&amp;R teacher. At this point, the M&amp;R teacher reviews the program needs of
the student and decides if new or further assessment is necessary. It is
important to note that much of the assessment is done through observation
rather than formal testing. The M&amp;R teacher reviews the information and
makes recommendations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Program adjustment:</strong> The M&amp;R teacher and the classroom teacher develop
an IEP for the student which includes recommendations from the assessment.
Together they modify the regular program or develop special programs to
meet the student&#8217;s needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parents are frequently asked for their input, as it is imperative that
home and school focus on similar goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some parents are very involved in setting goals for their children, wanting
their children to be included in regular programs and activities as much
as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IEP is generally written with both short and long term goals and may
be adjusted frequently. If something in the program is not working, the
classroom teacher and M&amp;R teacher revise the program. Flexibility is
important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Assistance through various stages:</strong> Regular classroom teachers of children
with special needs almost always need assistance in modifying programs
and instruction. The methods and resource teacher is a strong support in
these areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher helps select appropriate materials, and organizes them so
they can be used effectively. The classroom teacher keeps the M&amp;R teacher
informed on the usefulness of the materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher helps the classroom teacher to identify the student&#8217;s
learning style; using this information, he or she helps select the best
methods of teaching the student. He or she may even help out in the classroom
when the regular teacher first puts a new, specialized program into action.
In some cases, the M&amp;R teacher may work in the classroom with the student
on an ongoing basis to meet the student&#8217;s needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The classroom teacher implements the programs or methods recommended by
the M&amp;R teacher, and reports any success or failure. If the M&amp;R teacher
has been working one-on-one with the student in the classroom, the classroom
teacher watches and discusses the strategies and methods in order to carry
them over into other classroom activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together the M&amp;R and classroom teachers decide on evaluation procedures
where appropriate and organize a schedule for evaluation. The classroom
teacher does any testing and keeps a record of procedures used. The test
results are used as a guide in revising the IEP if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teacher will assist the classroom teacher in reporting to parents;
he or she will also consult with parents on any matters regarding their
child which arises in the classroom.</p>
</div>

Other members of the support team within a school include attendants, who
are available to help with children with total care needs such as feeding
and taileting. Aides, on the other hand, generally assist in the amdemic
program. Both attendants and aides receive their instructions from the
classroom teacher who remains responsible for the programs and students
in the class. The classroom teacher may also seek support from psychologists,
speech pathologists, diagnosticians, specialists for children who are
blind or deaf, and sometimes physiotherapists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When problems arise, the classroom teacher can request that a problem-solving
team be formed by the M&amp;R staff. The team is a problem-solving unit made
up of volunteer staff members
<a href="#_chapter_12">(see Chapter 12)</a>
.
Frequently, the team includes the school guidance counsellor, district
psychologists, a member of the administration, and, of course, the M&amp;R
staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The team approaches the problem using a prescribed plan, and offers a series
of possible options for the classroom teacher. Follow-up sessions are
arranged to provide the teacher with continued support if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These resources help teachers do the best possible job. A close working
relationship with people in these supportive roles ensures that the
student with special needs will be assessed accurately and that feasible
programs will be drawn up which are implemented properly. A close
relationship also makes teachers feel that they are not alone; the value
of that support is immeasurable.</p>

<h4 id="_conclusion_4">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My goal has been to show the simplicity of integration. In fact, so much
of what has been described here is already accomplished well by teachers
every day in clasrooms everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any teacher who believes it is his or her professional responsibility to
accept and teach all children will find a way to make integration work. Any
teacher who believes it is his or her personal responsibility to uphold
the value of all children will do so.</p>

<p>The classroom teacher always, ultimately, controls the expectations and
accomplishments of the students for whom he or she is responsible. Five
years of experience in the integration of children with disabilities into
regular classrooms has shown me that the teacher who sets an example for
others, especially students, in the acceptance of children with disabilities
and mental handicaps in the regular classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where teachers have taken the initiative in accepting a child with a
disability and are actively working to promote acceptance and interaction,
the child has been accepted by peers in the classroom. Conversely, when a
child with a disability has been supported entirely by a teacher assistant,
with minimal teacher interaction, he or she has not become a true member
of the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, it is vitally important that the teacher develop strategies
for involving all children in classroom activities so all students will
be seen as valuable members of the class.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to make this accommodation within a single classroom setting,
teachers are now challenged with the task of restructuring their classroom
practice. As an alternative to preparing and teaching a number of different
lessons within a single class, teachers must develop a framework for planning
that allows for one main lesson with varying methods of presentation,
practise, and evaluation. Multi-level instruction is one approach to the
development of this framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_multi_level_instruction">WHAT IS MULTI-LEVEL INSTRUCTION?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-level instruction (Schulz and Turnhull, 1984) is based on the premise
that one lesson will be taught to the whole class. It is an approach to
planning that assumes the individualization, flexibility and inclusion of
all students regardless of their personal level of skills. It allows the
teacher to plan for all students within one lesson, thereby decreasing
the necessity for separate programs while allowing the teacher to weave
individual goals into the classroom content and instructional strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to achieve this, teachers need to fully understand the concept
of multi-level teaching strategies. To develop a unit or a lesson that is
truly multi-level, the lesson must have a definite aim for all students.
It must also include a variety of teacher techniques aimed at reaching
students at all levels. This means:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>considering student learning styles when planning presentation methods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>involving them in the lesson through questioning aimed at differerent
levels of thinking (e.g., Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, a taxonomy of levels of
cognitive difficulty developed by Beniamin Bloom, a psychologist and
educational theorist at the University of Chicago,
<a href="#BloomPage">(see Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy)</a>
;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>allowing that some students will need adjusted expectations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving students a choice in what method they will use to
demonstrate their understanding of the concept being taught;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accepting that these different methods are of equal value;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating students based on their individual differences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_four_step_process_in_developing_a_lesson">THE FOUR-STEP PROCESS IN DEVELOPING A LESSON</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to develop a lesson that meets these objectives,
teachers may use the following four-step process as a guide:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>identify the underlying concepts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the teacher method of presentation (teaching style, questioning
techniques, partial participation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the student method of practice (allowing for variation in
assignments based on Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, different presentation modes, and
partial participation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the method of student evaluation (considering different levels
of skill and accepting a variety of evaluation procedures).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_step_one_identification_of_underlying_concepts">STEP ONE: IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERLYING CONCEPTS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step is to identify the underlying concepts to be taught within
a unit or a particular lesson. It is important to understand that underlying
concepts are not merely the objectives established for a particular course.
Objectives may be only part of a much broader picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers must identify, in the material they are teaching, what they would
like all the students in the class to understand when the lesson has
been completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different content may be necessary for students with different levels of
skill. However at the end of the lesson all students should have a similar
understanding of the concept, taking into consideration the level at which
they are working.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will involve close scrutiny of the materials to be taught. Many school
programs now in use especially at the junior and senior-level, rely heavily
on the teaching of content.
The difficulty with teaching excessive content is that many students who
could successfully grasp the overall concept cannot master all the content.
There is a need to clarify the difference between the underlying concepts
and the content which is used to develop these concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine a traditional lesson on conflict within a story taught at the
junior or senior high school level. Students are generally expected to
recognize specific types of liteary conflict. This is evaluated by having
them read a particular story or novel with the aim of identifying examples
of conflict. It is easy to imagine the difficulty experienced by students
working at a reading level below that of the reading material. The difficulty
is not in understanding the concept of conflict but in reading the material
in order to complete the assignment. By placing emphasis on the ability
to read and write without allowing other means for demonstrating learning
or illustrating knowledge of conflict, students are &#8220;handicapped&#8221; by the
structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of expecting all students to know the types of literary conflict
and read all the material, the teacher can approach this concept in a
broader sense. If the teacher were to concentrate on acquainting all
students with an understanding of conflict and have them identify the types
through examples in real life, the types could later he related to a
particular novel or short story. This would allow all students to be
involved in the concept while variations are made in the assignments to
accommodate different levels of skill.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_step_two_methods_of_teacher_presentation">STEP TWO: METHODS OF TEACHER PRESENTATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the underlying concepts of the lesson are established, it is clear
that the lesson cannot be presented in one way to all students, if all
students are to be sucessful. Therefore, the idea or concept to be barned
must be presented in such a way that all students are able to gain
varying degrees of knowledge based on their level of understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Learning Styles of Students</em></strong>
The teacher must remember that a class is made up of students who learn
visually, auditorially, and kinaesthetically. Most children tend to use
one perceptual style more than the others. Teachers need to plan
instruction which addresses each student&#8217;s dominant perceptual mode.
Although eighty to eightyfive per cent of students are visual learners,
teachers tend to teach most often in an auditory fashion. Teachers could
meet the needs of visual learners by using the blackboard more and
incorporating filmstrips, films, pictures, charts, and overhead transparencies
into their lesson presentation (Wood, 1984).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers should obtain more information about perceptual learning modes,
observable behaviours connected to each mode, and teaching techniques for
each mode (Wood, 1984; Schulz and Turnbull, 1984).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To return to the example of teaching elements of a story or novel, in
using the multi-level approach to teach the idea of setting in stories a
variety of different modes could be used. The idea of setting could be
introduced by getting students to discuss their own lives. This would
allow each student to express orally, perhaps to a partner, the setting
of his or her life. A student with limited verbal ability might be asked
specific questions by a student who has been coached in what to ask.
Another approach might be to discuss the setting of a picture, a television
show, or a story chosen by the student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an elementary lesson on capitalization, a discovery approach could be
used. Instead of the teacher giving the student rules for capitalization,
the student could be given a paragraph, asked to locate the capital letters,
and then, in a group, discuss why capital letters were used in those
particular situations. In this way the students have to come up with rules
on their own rather than memorize rules given to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a math lesson on percent, students could be asked questions based on
particular objects that are in the room. For example, they could be asked
to give the percentage of windows that are open; the percentage of students
in the classroom who have blue eyes; a percentage to indicate the number
of students absent from the class that day; or various other problems that
the teachers could devise. Thess questions would not be based on problems
from a text book but on relevant material that is at hand. Those students
who have difficulty with reading would be able to work on the concept of
percent from these preliminary problems without having to worry about being
able to read a problem from a textbook.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Levels of Cognitive Domains</em></strong><br>
Another consideration in presenting the lesson should be the involvement
of students at their own level. This requires the use of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy
in the development of questions and assignments. Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, or other
similar structures that indicate levels of thinking, are useful in structuring
questions to ask students at various levels. All students can be involved
in the lesson if suitable questions are developed to allow their involvement.
Although Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy is well known, it is utilized less than would
be expected for preparing questions and assignments for students. The chart
that follows indicates the levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, defines each level,
lists key verbs used to ask students questions, and lists products or
activities that students could produce or perform at the indicated level.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Gearhart, Welshahn, &amp; Gearhart, 1988)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Levels one and two, knowledge and comprehension, are used most often
by teachers. The remaining four levels&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;application, analysis,
synthesis, and evaluation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;should be used by teachers more often than
they are at present. Even for students who have difficulty with learning,
the higher levels of the taxonomy should be utilized. A student with
learning difficulties could still do a question at the evaluation level
as long as the question was relevant to the student&#8217;s own life or
dealt with concrete rather than abstract ideas. Evaluation of various
ideas is an important skill that all students should be encouraged to
develop. The teacher has to work with students at their current level of
skill to encourage them to develop higher thinking skills to the best of
their ability. Students
experiencing learning difficulties should not be kept at the knowledge
and comprehension level. In fact, these areas are often very difficult
for students to master because of the heavy reliance on the memorization
of material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Partial Participation</em></strong><br>
Whether a student should participate fully or only partially is decided
in the planning as well. Partial participation might involve each student
doing a segment of an activity based on his or her level of skill. Group
work with each member assigned a different task is the most common example.
A student who is able to understand a concept but works more slowly than
the rest of the class may have two options:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>to have more time to complete the same objectives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be responsible for understanding the concept but to not have to
complete all the activities required of other members of the class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Partial participation is particularly important for students with more
severe learning disabilities. Students who are unable to do the main
objectives of the lesson but have their own specific objectives can be
included in the activities of the class but their participation will
certainly not be at the same level as other students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a student with very little written language might be expected
to be involved in the public speaking unit in the Language Arts program
at the junior or senior level. However, the expectation for his or her
presentation would be different from that of the other class members.
The student might be expected to do an oral presentation that is shorter
in length and based on a personel experience rather than on a topic that
has to be researched.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_step_three_methods_of_student_practice_and_performance">STEP THREE: METHODS OF STUDENT PRACTICE AND PERFORMANCE</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third step in the four-step process for multi-level instruction
is determining the method of student performance. The method of
performance that the student utilizes to show he or she understands
the concept taught should follow the same variations discussed under
method of presentation. There should be an allowance for assignments
based on varying modes of learning, assignments based on different
levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, and assignments that show partial
participation. This will allow students who would not be able to
read a story, for example, to be taught the concept of setting and to
complete assignments to illustrate this understanding.
Assignments might be oral or written, or involve drawing or acting.
If the main objective is to have all the students understand setting,
it can be reached in many ways, all of which are equally valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In allowing for different methods of student performance, perhaps the
most fundamental issue is the idea of choice. Students must be
allowed a variety of different ways to show that they understand a
concept. This involves an acceptance that the written word is not
the only way of expressing understanding. It also involves instilling
in students an acceptance that other ways of expressing understanding
of a concept are of equal value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What must be discouraged is the idea that the written word is the most
important way to express ideas, and that drawing or illustrating is done
only by students who are unable to express themselves in the more vital
written format. When all methods of expression considered of equal value
and all students are encouraged to express their views in different ways,
the students will begin to see all methods as having equal value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teachers will have concerns related to the seeming de-emphasis on
reading and writing skills. The examples of alternate methods of student
performance are an attempt to emphasize different presentation techniques,
not to suggest that reading and writing be avoided. The intention is to
ensure that attempts are made through various teaching styles to reach
all students. All students should be able to appreciate and understand
the main idea taught. There is no attempt to suggest that students will
not be expected to read selections or write responses where appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, some students will be unable to succeed with the prescribed
material, and alternate materials will have to be used so all students
can attempt similar activities. Many strategies can he used for reading
adaptations, including using textbooks or library books at a lower reading
level, taping books, highlighting pertinent materials in textbooks with
a coloured marker, providing study guides or outlines of the major concepts,
or rewriting material at a lower reading level (Schulz and Turnbull, 1984).
These methods still place an emphasis on reading and writing but at the
student&#8217;s appropriate level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Use of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy</em></strong><br>
Assignments should not only allow for different modes of presentation,
but should be written at different levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy (Bloom, 1969).
That way, students who need to be challenged more than they are by the
regular curriculum will have activities at their level; and students who
have difficulty doing work at the grade level will have activities that
allow them to express their knowledge in a different format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following activities, assigned to a class to show their understanding
of plot of a story, illustrate the use of different modes of presentation
and the different levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>Discuss the plot of television shows to allow for verbal rather than
written presentation.</em><br>
This task involves knowledge and comprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In small groups, write or discuss what each student did that day.</em><br>
This involves practice in sequencing so students can develop an
understanding of the order of events. It allows for small group activity
where students have the support of others who have more skill in the area,
and it allows them to all participate in an activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Use charades to act out events in a particular plot while the rest
of the students identify the part of the plot being shown.</em><br>
This allows students who are able to act the part to be very visible
in the lesson as well as show that they understand the events in the
story. It provides an opportunity for other students to analyze the
particular presentation and decide what is being shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Record sounds or music that could be used to illustrate certain
segments of the plot.</em><br>
This combines plot with atmosphere to challenge more advanced students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Write o plot in point form.</em><br>
This is helpful for weak writers to improve their writing skills, as well
as providing practice for other students in note-taking. The students with
more advanced skills would be expected to rewrite the points in paragraph
form.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="6">
<li>
<p><em>Complete collage of events on the plot.</em><br>
This allows students who have no written ability to illustrate
that they have an understanding of the plot by means of a visual
presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Explain which part of the plot is most convincing.</em><br>
This evaluation question can be done either orally or in a written
format. It allows all students to use evaluation as a technique and
allows them to do it in different formats based on their ability levels.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Sample Lesson One includes a number of other activities at various levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When students are presented with a variety of assignments at varying
levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, the need for enrichment as well as
modification can be met. Most students, when given the choice of
assignments, Will select one that is appropriate. However, there are two
notes of caution:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Some students will choose the activities which are the easiest for them,
as they may not be highly motivated. This can be monitored by having
students maintain a chart showing their choice of assignments in various
units as they are covered. Restrictions can be placed on the number
of activities a student may do from a particular unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students may feel they are unable to do certain activities and,
because they never choose them, they never have the opportunity to
improve their skills in that area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A student&#8217;s choice of assignments should reflect a reasonable balance
between the need to succeed for motivational purposes and need to learn
new skills for the purpose of future success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Partial Participation</em></strong><br>
In the area of method of student practice, partial participation is an
important concept. Students with very limited academic ability can still
be involved in activities in the class, based on their specific objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A student may be placed in a group in order to meet objectives in his or
her personal program. Objectives might focus on social skills or communication
skills. The teacher would be aware of the reasons for the student being
in the group and would concentrate on the development of the targeted skills,
rather than on the attainment of academic knowledge about a particular
subject. Examples of inclusion of students with special needs are found
in sample lessons
.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Specific Strategies</em></strong><br>
Cooperative learning is an excellent strategy to consider when choosing
a method of student performance (Johnson, Johnson and Holubec, 1984). It
accommodates partial participation by students who cannot do all the
required work. It allows for social skill development and cooperation
among all students, as well as providing a choise of activities that will
utilize the various levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy. Cooperative learning, as
a strategy, cute across two steps in the multi-level instruction process&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the method of teacher presentation and the method of student performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discovery approach is another strategy which covers both teacher
presentation and student performance. If the students, for example, are
expected to discover the rules for punctuation by completing an activity
initiated by the teacher, the method of teacher presentation is student
discovery and the method of student practice is also discovery.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_step_four_method_of_evaluation">STEP FOUR: METHOD OF EVALUATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fourth step in the process, the method of evaluation, is very closely
linked to the method of student performance and involves the same three
areas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;modes of studant performance, Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy and partial
participation. Students should he evaluated on their assignments with
equal weight being given to each mode of presentation. Written work is
not made more valuable than oral or artistic work. In this way, contributions
are of equal value and a student who cannot write is not devalued in the
eyes of the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy should he used in the development of test questions.
However, if different levels of questioning such as analysis, synthesis
or evaluation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which are not typical test questions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are included,
the student should be prepared for this type of questioning. It is not
appropriate to deal exclusively at the knowledge, comprehension, and
application level in the classroom and then expect students to make the
leap into the higher levels of thinking on test questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main point to remember is that, in multi-level instruction evaluation
is based on the individual level of skill of the students.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_summary">SUMMARY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In multi-level instruction: a concept is determined; a variety of methods
of presentation are employed to meet all learning styles; choices are
given in assignments to allow all students to participate; and evaluation
of students is based on the individual ability levels of the students.
Multi-level instruction is a means of developing lessons that allow all
students to participate to their fullest extent, and be legitimate members
of the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTI-LEVEL INSTRUCTION</em></strong><br>
Multi-level instruction does not consist of strategies designed for use
only in certain situations. It is a process that can be developed across
the curriculum. Therefore, it requires a great deal of commitment and
planning by teachers. It does not require extensive training, although it
does challenge teachers to rethink material previously taught. It may
mean that a teacher must abandon lesson plans used many times before, and
be open to new approaches to that same material. It requires time to plan
new lessons and a willingness to give up the role of presenter for that
of facilitator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-level instruction requires movement away from a teacher-controlled
classroom and towards more choice and autonomy for students. It is a means
of meeting the needs of students at their level while also meeting the
needs of the curriculum. This however, entails a great deal of work on
the part of teachers. Why should teachers be willing to expend the energy
that is necessary to bring about these changes?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Rationale for Multi-Level Instruction</em></strong><br>
One rationale for multi-level instruction is that it encourages inclusion
and integration. At the same time it addresses different learning styles.
It allows teachers to reach all of the students some of the time (it is
not possible to meet all of the needs of the students all of the time).
However, the use of a variety of techniques within the same unit or lesson
eliminates the need to teach the lesson many different times, in many
different ways, to meet the individual styles of the students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The multi-level instruction approach does take students beyond the
knowledge and comprehension levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy. It allows for
enrichment for very able students as well as modification for students
who have difficulties in learning. It stresses cooperation among students
and allows evaluation at individual skill levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows students choice in expressing the knowledge that they have gained.
It also meets students&#8217; social and emotional needs as well as their
academic needs. Student involvement with peers is encouraged because of
the emphasis on cooperative learning. Permanent grouping is discouraged.
This strategy fosters social relations in the classroom which are important
in making all students feel a part of the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-level instruction allows for participation of all students in the
learning process and an acceptance of each person&#8217;s contribution. It develops
and encourages the concept of self-worth in all students. Increased motivation
through the involvement of students in the activities of the classroom
makes classroom management easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The thought and planning needed to determine the underlying concept of the
material should result in a more meaningful curriculum. Teachers will be
aware of why something is being taught and will focus on helping students
understand various concepts, rather than on memorization of material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>TRAINING CLASSROOM TEACHERS</em></strong><br>
Today&#8217;s classroom teachers realize that many styles of education will be
neccessary to meet the needs of the variety of learners in their classroom.
Multi-level instruction is but one way to meet these needs. In order to
develop this skill, teachers require some initial training.
However, the main components of training in multi-level instruction are
time and practice in developing lesson plans that incorporate strategies
to allow for inclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In two particular school districts, training for classroom teachers was
provided in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Principals were asked to select one or two teachers who: a) would be
willing to train other teachers; b) were at present showing some success
with inclusion strategies; and c) were well respected by other staff
members for their competency. These teachers formed a cadre to be trained
and later to provide training to the rest of the staff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p>Schoolboards in the two districts agreed to allow an extra professional
development day before the end of the school year for in-service training.
Each school was allowed to choose its own day within certain time parameters.
District staff responsible for assisting in the training attended these
school-based training sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The selected teachers were brought together for a full-day training
session. They were then asked to practise the techniques of the multi-level
approach in their own classrooms. Selected lesson were viewed and  feedback
given by schoolboard staff. A second training day was provided to allow
for planning for the school training sessions. The teachers had the freedom
to present the material according to their own plan, although there had
to be a common outline to assure consistency across the schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods and resource teachers
<a href="#_chapter_8">(see Chapter 8)</a>
,
principals, and vice-principals received training in the fundamentals of
multi-level instruction so they could act as support personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The principals and vice-principals were responsible for developing a
plan to provide ongoing in-service training to the rest of the staff in
their school. The main focus was training in small groups with collaboration
among teachers; the groups also had time to develop and implement the newly
acquired skills. Principals and vice-principals supported the training by
monitoring the skills when they observed teachers as part of teacher
supervision; they also provided ways for teachers to share strategies at
various staff gatherings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was the ongoing responsibility of district staff to monitor the
implementation of the plans and provide assistance as requested.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The training approach used relies on collaboration among teachers in
developing and sustaining multi-level instructional strategies. A
collaborative team approach allows teachers to share ideas and support
colleagues who are feeling the stress of having to meet diversified needs
that they may not feel equipped to handle. There is no time limit for the
completion of training, as it must be an ongoing process that allows for
differing rates of acceptance of change by teachers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_concluson">CONCLUSON</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because teachers are now responsible for a greater diversity of students
in regular classrooms, a wider range of teaching strategies is needed to
meet the needs of these students. As the integration of students with special
needs has evolved, inclusion has become a major concern. Multi-level
instruction is a teaching method which allows teachers to meet the individual
needs of students and provide quality education for all. This will not be
easy to do, nor will it happen quickly. However, if inclusion of all is
to be a characteristic of the education system in the future, there must
be commitment to the development of multi-level instruction. That will
require a commitment to the ideology and a commitment to providing the
resources needed for its implementation. Both students and the education
system will achieve a higher level of success as a result.</p>

<p>One suggestion for teaching these concepts was through the use of a movie

students and particularly for two groups&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;visual learners, and children
with low reading levels. The concepts would be presented by a variety of
modes and then the novel could be the vehicle for project work based on

<p>The concept to be learned was &#8220;Who is Sir Wilfred Laurier?&#8221; Sir Wilfred
Laurier was discussed by the teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>His picture was used for identification. The students took turns reading
aloud material on Sir Wilfred Laurier. Students with reading difficulties
were given short sections with fairly easy vocabulary. The student with a
serious speech problem due to a brain injury was asked occasionally to
choose the next reader. In checking for learning, a number of students
were asked to name the first French-Canadian prime minister. After a few
students answered correctly, the student with the speech difficulty was
asked the same question but only had to say his lastname. She he was also
expected to identify his picture from the pictures of prime ministers
posted around the room. For seatwork she was given a picture of Laurier
with his name written under it and another sheet with the same picture and
a blankspace under it. She was required to write his name in the space.

the teacher assisted the child by showing her how to fold the paper and
by allowing her to feel it after each step. The child was able to see,
through touch, the flat sheet of paper turn into the desired model. This
technique could be used for teaching other concepts, such as perimeter,

<h4 id="_problem_solving_strategies_for_teachers">PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES FOR TEACHERS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Schools which successfully include all students must employ a range of
strategies and techniques so teachers can gain the support they need.
The teacher-helping-teacher problem solving strategy has proven to be an
effective method of creating open, productive collaborative consultation
among educators. We have developed and refined the strategy over several
years. It has been particularly useful as we have implemented integrated
or inclusionary programs for all students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fundamental principle of the process is that <em>teachers can help other
teachers</em>. Problem solving proceeds through an orderly sequence of steps
from the initial designation of the problem to the development and
implementation of a plan to resolve it, to evaluation of progress, to
monitoring. The process is dynamic, evolving, flexible, and cyclical
in nature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_history">HISTORY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programs for teachers of students with special needs have come under a
variety of labels: pre-referral intervention; teacher support teams; and
teacher assistant teams (Canelli and Lange, 1990; West, 1990; Chalfant,
Pysh and Moultrie, 1979). Our present use of problem-solving teams in
New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29 originated with the teacher
assistant team (TAT) concept developed by James Chalfant and his associates
in the United States. This model was created to address the increasing
referral of students to special education services and to stop the flow
of referrals for formal assessment. The goal was to handle more situations
at the school level, reduce the number of inappropriate referrals, and
use special education personnel more effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1979 we brought Chalfant and Pysh to our district to train teachers
and administrators from each school in the use of their model. Subsequently,
schools set up teams by either recruiting volunteers, holding elections
or having the principal choose team members. Despite the fact that results
were mixed and the model eventually fell into disuse with teams disbanding
in most schools, we had many positive experiences with the TAT model.
Those experiences became a useful resource as teachers worked hard to meet
the challenge of integrating students. We looked anew at the elements of
the TAT model that were most compelling for our circumstances and our
present day problem-solving teams become an outgrowth of our experience
with the teacher assistant team model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our revised model is a mix of old and new ideas. The purpose of referral
is now to give teachers needed support to keep all students in regular
classes. The facilitator is most often a school-based methods and resource
teacher or a guidance counsellor. The make-up of the teams is flexible
and open to whatever considerations seem relevant. The process followed
during the thirty-minute meeting, however, is similar to the TAT model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most meaningful changes has been the perspective brought by
the teachers themselves. Changes that occurred during the last decade,
particularly the move to integration, have altered our assumptions of
educational practice and made teachers much more open to working cooperatively
with their peers. It has become understood that teachers can no longer
work in isolation and still meet the needs of every student. They
increasingly accept the philosophy of collaborative consultation, &#8220;an
interactive process which enables people with diverse expertise and
experiences to generate creative solutions to mutually defined problems.
The outcome is enhanced, altered, and different from the original solutions
that any team memeber would produce independently&#8221; (Nevin et al., 1990).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_features_of_the_collaborative_model">FEATURES OF THE COLLABORATIVE MODEL</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_collaborative_partnership">Collaborative Partnership</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several important features of problem solving in a collaborative
environment. The first is that team members work together to solve problems
in a partnership that emphasizes trust, openness, and cooperation. Being
collaborative implies that they work jointly on an equal basis, and
partnership suggests that they have specified and mutually agreed-upon
responsibilities. This equality ensures that collaboration is effective,
deriving the maximum benefit from the consultation process
(Villa et al., 1990).
Out of these balanced relationships come &#8220;people and systems that are
more self-help oriented, more self-sustaining, and more pro-social&#8221;.
The process also helps increase people&#8217;s confidence in their ability to
solve problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Members of the teams make different contributions based on their expertise
and varying responsibilities; they work together in a complementary and
interdependent fashion. The teachers bringing problems to the team must
provide information on context and ecological factors affecting the situation
which will help in developing interventions. They must also help in
deciding what interventions will be most useful in their setting based
on their skills (Idol, 1990).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All participants are responsible for defining and analyzing problems, for
establishing and maintaining the collaborative partnership, and for
follow-up. Since the referring teacher is responsible for the student
and for implementing the interventions, he or she is the best judge of
what strategies are suitable and makes the final decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Preventative Function</em></strong><br>
Problem solving has a dual focus. It provides a mechanism to deal with
immediate problems, and it has the potential to help teachers control
the factors that cause and maintain the problem. It can both ease existing
problems and prevent existing difficulties from being more severe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first objective is met by developing specific interventions to deal
with the current problem. The second is accomplished in a less direct
manner. Teachers can share their experience and expertise with each other
when they interact frequently. Problem-solving sessions meats the
opportunities for interaction. Teachers can share knowledge and improve
their skills so similar problems can be dealt with more effectively in
the future. In most cases, it is necessary for teachers to address several
problem situations successfully before they can handle problems independently.
Training teachers to deal with a single problem situation has been
ineffective in teaching them general skills for coping with a variety of
circumstances (Pryzwansky, 1989).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Participants</em></strong><br>
The team should have five to seven members. At minimum, a facilitator and
three other teachers are needed to make the problem-solving process work
effectively. As noted earlier, the facilitator is often a methods and
resource teacher or guidance counsellor, but can also be an administrator
or teacher. On occasion the student who is the central figure in the
situation may be requested to participate since he or she has the most
at stake in the process (Thousands and Villa, in press, b).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The facilitator must ensure that the atmosphere remains supportive and
non-judgemental. The facilitator must identify possible participants,
schedule the meeting and ensure that teachers share their expertise and
knowledge so creative solutions emerge. He or she must also assist the
teacher in selecting stratagies for possible use, in developing an evaluation
plan, and in follow-up and implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Addressing the System</em></strong><br>
Regular use of problem solving leads educators to look beyond the immediate
situation to prevention and, ultimately, to issues related to the organization
of the school. School organization can bring about many day-to-day problems
food by students and teachers (Skrtic, 1991). The connection between a
student&#8217;s problem and system variables that may be contributing to the
problem or preventng solutions must be identified and dealt with.
Educators cannot assume that problems are only internal to the child.
This perspective shifts the focus and broadens the goals of the consultation
or problem-solving process (Gutkin and Hickman, 1990).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Empowerment</em></strong><br>
The empowerment of regular classroom teachers is central to the use of
problem-solving teams. The emphasis on collaboration with peers rather
than referral to &#8220;experts&#8221; is an important factor in this empowerment.
Colleagues help fellow teachers clarify needs and locate resources; at
the same time they ensure that opportunities are available to constructively
resolve their own problems (West, 1990).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Enhancement of Student Well-Being and Performance</em></strong>
Although problem solving focuses on improving teacher&#8217;s skills and performance,
the ultimate beneficiary is always intended to be the student. While the
focus is usually on one student, it is possible to see the entire school
benefit.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_team_problem_solving_process">THE TEAM PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers usually work to solve problems on their own before seeking
consultative assistance. Typically, they try various classroom interventions,
confer informally with other teachers, or meet with parents. The teacher
may seek advice from a resource person because of his or her expertise
or because a supportive relationship has developed between them. Most
classroom problems are solved in this manner. If independent problem
solving doesn&#8217;t work, teachers may request assistance from a colleague
at the school or district office, or from the school problem-solving team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meetings with a team can be requested by the teacher or suggested by a
resource person, typically a methods and resource teacher, or by the
school principal. Meetings must be formally arranged because of the
work involved in coordinating five to seven people. Problem-solving team
meetings are effective for particularly frustrating situations, or when
it is deemed important to promote communication among a number of teachers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consultation does not end with the peer problem-solving meeting. It may
be decided, for example, that it is more efficient to have an methods and
resources teacher, guidance counsellor or district-level resource person
work with the referring teacher to thoroughly develop the specifics of a
particular intervention.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_stages_of_problem_solving_meetings">STAGES OF PROBLEM-SOLVING MEETINGS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The facilitator states the reason for the meeting and explains
the process to be followed and the problem to be dealt with. He or she
can also outline the problem-solving process if needed. Additional
responsibilities of the team facilitator include:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>helping the referring teacher state clearly and concisely what the
problem is by finding out specifically what the teacher wants to happen
that is not happening now. The more precise the problem is stated, the
better;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>briefing the other team members on the problem. This is not always
necessary, but often helps the prrocess;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asking one team member to act as recorder. This member can still be an
active participant in the group;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helping each team member stay on topic, and give clear, appropriate,
practical suggestions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the meeting lasts no longer than thirty minutes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who have participated in problem-solving meetings state that
facilitators should be positive, business-like, task-oriented, and able
to clarify issues and summarize well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> The referring teacher makes a brief oral statement about the
problematic situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Team members ask questions of the referring teacher to clear
up any uncertainties they may have as to exactly what the problem is or
what the circumstances are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stages 2 and 3 permit team members to focus on defining the parameters
of the problem for the teacher. After the referring teacher provides
a vignette of the situation and his or her concerns, team members may ask
for somes pecific examples of the behaviour, such as &#8220;You find that
Susan is aggressive toward other children. Can you give me some specific
examples of her aggressive behaviour?&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During stage 3, team members may:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Look for factors that may trigger or maintain a problem; identify and
analyze conditions that alleviate the problem.<br>
(&#8220;Does Mary seem to work better when you&#8230;&#8203; ?&#8221;);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for consequences that may maintain the behaviour. They may explore
actions that are already occurring or could be instituted to improve
behaviour or performance.<br>
(&#8220;What do you do when Joe does complete all off his homework?&#8221; &#8220;What
types of things does Julie really like to do?&#8221;);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess other factors in the student&#8217;s environment. Significant people
in the student&#8217;s environment are identified and asked questions to assess
their attitudes and expectations regarding the problem. Relevant
instructional variables and classroom or home routines are explored;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify all available resources; identify the strengths of the child.<br>
(&#8220;What types of things does Jeff do well?&#8221; &#8220;In what subject area is
William succeeding?&#8221;)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of clarification helps make the problem specific enough that
team members feel they understand it clearly.
The facilitator provides input to pull the threads together so the team
has a mutual sense of the issues causing a problem for the referring teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Once the problem has been clearly defined and analyzed, a range
of possible interventions must be generated. A round-table brainstorming
session is held to generate suggestions from team members as to how the
problem may be solved. Brief, practical statements are encouraged, and
are directed to the facilitator.The referring teacher does not interact
with others at this stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The central rule of this phase of the process is to avoid evaluating
ideas until the brainstorming segment is completed. There is often more
than one way to rsolve a problem, and by generating a number of possible
solutions the team is more likely to come up with an intervention that
is both effective and acceptable to the referring teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Team members usually suggest some change in classroom management or
instructional strategies in areas like curriculum content, rewards or
instructional techniques. They may also suggest changes to teacher
behaviour, peer and sibling behaviour, and the physical arrangement of
the classroom<br>
(Gutkin and Hickman, 1990).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> The facilitator and the referring teacher go over the
suggestions and strategies together. The referring teacher evaluates them
to determine how beneficial they will be for the child and how feasible
it is to implement them. The ultimate selection of strategies rests with
the referring teacher who is asked to rate each suggestion by assigning
a number to it:<br>
number 1 is an idea or strategy that the teacher wants to try
immediately;<br>
number 2 is an idea or strategy that has merit, but is not a priority;
and<br>
number 3 is an idea or strategy that has already been tried or is not
seen as immediately practical by the referring teacher.<br>
When rating strategies, teachers should keep in mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Interventions should focus on the positive rather than on control and
suppression of challenging behaviour;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p>Teachers should choose the least complex and intrusive intervention.
Where possible, the focus should be on helping the referring teacher modify
instruction or general behaviour management strategies. Making changes to
techniques the teacher already uses is intrusive or aversive to the
teacher than learning a new procedure (Axelrod, 1990);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a new skill must be developed by the teacher, it should be designed
to fit into the present classroom structure and routine as much as possible
(Conoley and Conoley, 1988).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 6:</strong> The facilitator establishes a plan to follow up on the ideas
or strategies that have been selected by the teacher. This might include
arranging for more detail on a specific idea, providing assistance in
further developing a plan of action, or setting a date for a future
meeting to evaluate the plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The roles and responsibilities of all participants must be assigned and
agreed upon. All aspects the plan should be put in writing, at least in
outline form, so each person involved has a clear idea of his or her
responsibilities. The specific techniques to be used should be set out
step-by-step in the outline.
The time of day and the settings or subject area in which the intervention
will be implemented must be decided. This written plan also serves as a
record for people&#8217;s accountability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 7:</strong> The facilitator thanks team members and ensures that all
participants leave feeling that something constructive will come from
the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers always have favourable comments regarding problem-solving
meetings. They appreciate the variety of practical suggestions that
result from the meeting. They are pleased that it only takes thirty
minutes from beginning to end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They report a ripple effect from the process where the solutions developed
in the meeting may be relevant to other problems. And the teachers leave
the meeting feeling empowered and supported by their peers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_case_studies">CASE STUDIES</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two case studies of actual problem-solving meetings provide specific
details that illustrate the operation of a problem-solving team. The first
is from an elementary school and the second is from a high school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Case Study One: Amanda</em></strong><br>
Amanda is a nine-year-old student in Grade 4. She is having difficulty
in language arts. Though she likes books and expresses herself well
verbally, she is not a fluent reader and does not expess herself well in
writing. She is described as being very cooperative and anxious to succeed.
However, she lacks organizational skills, independent work habits and a
level of comprehension necessary for her to be successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She was referred to the school methods and resource teacher by her home
room teacher. The methods and resource teacher completed a reading
assessment and located suitable reading material for Amanda. Her teacher
tried physically separating her from a particular student Amanda seemed
to find distracting. The teachers also attempted to find something to
praise her for every day. A problem-solving meeting was set up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The methods and resource teacher, acting as the facilitator,
welcomed the participants who included the referring teacher, the guidance
counsellor, and three other teachers. She stated that the purpose of the
meeting was to help the referring teacher find some practical suggestions
to help Amanda in language arts class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> The referring teacher gave a brief description of Amanda and
specified that he wanted her to improve her reading skills and to work
independently, and also to gain self-confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Team members now had a chance to ask any questions for clarification.
One member wanted to know whether there was support from the home, which
there was.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> During the brainstorming session all suggestions were directed
to the facilitator. The suggestions were:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Have Amanda read to a younger student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeatd reading: have Amanda read the same story several times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have her keep a journal to express her feelings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet with her parents to develop a plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make up a checklist of things that she has to do to be more organized.
She can check off each item as she completes it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have her copy class rules for a display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the homeroom teacher discuss with her how important it is to ask
for help. Include peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit homework time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a private signal with her that will indicate that she needs
help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use computer software to help with reading and writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teach Amanda the five-finger test for choosing her own reading material.
Take a book and open it to any page and as you read put a finger down for
any word you don&#8217;t know.
Five fingers for one page means the book is too difficult; no fingers
means it is too easy; somewhere in between is best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have Amanda present oral book reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that homework is related to reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have Amanda read to a parent for fifteen minutes every night. Have them
read alternate paragraphs to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that Amanda is not singled out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="16">
<li>
<p>Make Amanda responsible for fewer questions than the
rest of the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have her write daily about herself. It should be short and should
be marked and returned with constructive criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise her for good health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have someone read to her every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have Amanda repeat directions to make sure that she understands what
is expected of her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have her write with a peer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Specific Skills Series reading comprehension book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan a time every day to check on her organization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> The facilitator and the referring teacher went over
the suggestions and the referring teacher assigned either
number 1: an idea to try immediately; number 2: a good idea,
but not a priority; or number 3: an idea that has already been
tried or would not work. In this case, the referring teacher
choose three ideas to try immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 6:</strong> The facilitator assisted the referring teacher in
establishing the following action plan:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The methods and resource teacher will arrange and participate
in a meeting with Amanda&#8217;s parents to discuss her progress to date
and to begin formulating a plan for her success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanda will begin repeated readings. The methods and resource
teacher will supply a one-hundred-word passage each week and a chart
to record the mistakes and time the exercise takes each day. Since
these will both decrease, this activity will give Amanda a sense of
accomplishment and greater self-confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanda will write daily about herself (about My Favourite Pet,
What I Like About My Friend&#8217;s House, My Favourite Holiday). This
exercise will be short and will be marked and returned to Amanda
with constructive criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A follow-up meeting will take place in four weeks to review progess.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 7:</strong> The facilitator thanked the participants and assured
each one that their help was greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The follow-up meeting was held to assess progress to date. The
referring teacher was extremely pleased with the results of the
suggestions which he had tried after the problem-solving meeting.
He and the methods and resource teacher had met with Amanda&#8217;s
mother and found her to be cooperative. The suggestions for
improving her reading and writing skills had been equally successful.
He had seen a remarkable improvement in Amanda&#8217;s writing and said
that she was reading with much more confidence now. His over-all
assessment was positive; he found the problem-solving process to be
a valuable strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Case Study Two: Nathan</em></strong>
Basically there is a behaviour problem. Nathan. a Grade 11 student,
disrupts the class, causes serious difficulties for other learners,
and refuses to take responsibility for his own behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The facilitator explained that the purpose of the meeting
was to help the referring teacher develop some strategies to deal
with Nathan, a student in her Grade 11 English class. The facilitator
specified that the referring teacher was looking for ideas to confront
Nathan with the reality of the sffects of his behaviour and also some
strategies to help change his behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> The referring teacher elaborated on the problem by stating
that Nathan&#8217;s disruptive behaviours included pushing desks, striking out
to other students, staying turned around in his seat, and continually
talking. When she talked to him privately about this, Nathan refused to
accept that there was a problem; instead, he blamed the other students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>His seat had been changed a number of times, but this had not helped.
His work had been modified because of his weak reading skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> The following questions were asked for clarification:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does he have friends in that room? (Not really.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is he really good at? (Spelling, baketball.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is his behaviour the same outside the class? (Yes.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does he have friends outside the class? (He spends time with one or two
students.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does he change his behaviour after you speak to him? (For a few minutes.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does her react to one-on-one talks with you? (He gets very angry.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is work experience part of his program? (Not yet, but he will be going
out to work at a later date.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> The brainstorming session provided the following suggestions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Choose the smallest behaviour that you want to stop and develop a plan

<h4 id="_conclusion_5">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tom Skrtic (1991) has criticized education systems for their rigidity and
inability to be truly adaptive to the needs of students. He advocates that
schools must operate as adhocracies where both students and teachers work
in a collaborative manner, applying their unique strengths to the problems
of the group, and pooling their resources to come up
with novel and innovative ways to meet student needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Education is seen as a dynamic and flexible process constantly attuned to
the needs of the learners. The adhocratic school has a problem-solving
focus, involving collaboration among a number of professionals who pool
their skills as peers in the group. In this system, teachers have the
freedom to problem solve without fear of criticism. They can also develop
confidence that the system is flexible enough to allow innovative solutions
to he implemented. In addition, the range of feasible solutions is mostly
increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have found teacher collaboration in the form of peer problem-solving
teams helpful as we work to integrate students with disabilities into
regular classrooms in our schools. The process provides a way to help
teachers develop strategies to instruct students who do not easily fit
the standard curriculum or instructional assumptions. Peer problem-solving
teams have helped us promote the goals of inclusionary schooling. A
commitment to collaboration is needed to create schools where mutual
support in solving problems prevails.</p>

<p><em>by Julie Stone and Charlotte Campbell</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In four years as consultants for the integration of students with a mental
handicap, we have had the opportunity to observe, analyze and compare
many classrooms. We have found that the inclusion of students with
disabilities in regular classes has been most effective in schools where
supportive and interdependent relationships between students have been
successfully developed. In fact, many teachers and parents are beginning
to realize that one of the basic reasons for including students with
disabilities in schools and classrooms is so they can be supported in
building relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Weebster&#8217;s dictionary defines a relationship as the state or condition
that exists between people or groups of people who deal with one another.
In schools, students spend most of the day interacting with the curriculum
and with each other. Teachers have found that curriculum and regular
classroom activities operate as a springboard for the learning necessary
for students to form relationships and became happy and successful in
their adult lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_factors_of_successful_integration">FACTORS OF SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have identified many important factors which contribute to the success
of integration: the belief that all students are
capable of learning; the day-to-day modelling of effective leadership; an
in-school approach to problem solving; and the inclusion of parents in
the planning process. These are contributing factors; they set the stage
for integration. They do not, however, guarantee the same quality of
learning and the increased social relationships which exist in classrooms
where teachers deliberately plan for peer interaction and for participation
of students with disabilities in regular curriculum activities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_support_in_building_relationships">SUPPORT IN BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>The Importance of Friendships</em></strong><br>
Full inclusion in the integrated school depends on the recognition that
supporting students to build relationships with their peers is a critical
aspect of school life. Teachers who have had experience in integrating
students with disabilities acknowledge that students who are accepted,
liked and involved with their peers show gains in academic, social and
physical development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students who have spent years in segregated, &#8220;handicapped only&#8221; settings
have been denied opportunities to form the social relationships enjoyed
by their non-handicapped peers. Depending on the nature of the student&#8217;s
disabilities, relationships formed in special classes tend to be adult-child
rather than child-child relationships. They are dependent relationships
rather than friendships born of mutual interest, attraction, or common
skills. Relationships formed in segregated settings also tend to be
one-sided helping relationships that are usually not reciprocal in nature.
Teachers help students, but there is little possibility for students to
help teachers or peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While teacher-student relationships are important, educators and parents
have realized the importance of student-student relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers in integrated settings realize that in order to compensate for
the lack of opportunities for students with disabilities to form relationships
with non-handicapped peers, situations must be set up in the classroom to
encourage and teach disabled and non-disabled learners to interact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The skills for working in groups, solving problems and tolerating differences
can be learned by all students if they are invited to participate in classroom
learning activities. We have observed that teachers have created a variety
of ways to encourage such relationships.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_developing_student_to_student_interaction">DEVELOPING STUDENT-TO-STUDENT INTERACTION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Cooperative Learning</em></strong><br>
Cooperative learning is an effective strategy that provides opportunities
for students with disabilities to participate and build relationships with
their non-disabled peers. Cooperative learning involves structuring learning
tasks so that students work together in small groups to achieve shared
academic goals (Johnson, Maruyama, Johnson, Nelson and Skon, 1981).
Students are accountable and responsible for their own achievement, as well
as for the performance of the other members of their group. They also
practise social roles as they work to solve problems, learn new material
or create projects and documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incentives are built into cooperative learning activities to encourage
children in the group to work together to teach each other components of
the lesson. By using criterion-refenenced evaluation, teachers can modify
and individualize goals to fit certain students&#8217; abilities without
jeopardizing evaluation for the group (Campbell, Campbell, Collicott,
Perner and Stone, 1988).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who regularly use the principles of cooperative learning report
that it is a powerful tool in teaching children to respect and get along
with each other and in improving the social and academic climate of the
classroom. One teacher explains:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We worked in groups often. In these groups, no matter what, there was always
something that Dennis could do successfully, whether it was describing pictures,
repeating words or role-playing. It did not take long for the other students
to become adept at creating ways Dennis could actively participate in their
group. Their ideas and suggestions often far surpassed my own.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Bagnell<br>
<cite>1989</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research has shown that cooperative learning results in higher achievement
and greater retention of what is learned than do traditional competitive
or individual learning situations (Johnson, Maruyama, Johnson, Nelson and
Skon, 1981).
Other benefits, substantiated by research, include increased student
persistence in learning a task, more intrinsic motivation, higher levels
of self-esteem, acquisition of stronger collaborative skills, development
of positive peer relationships that extend beyond cooperative learning
activities, and the promotion of helping, sharing behaviours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As one teacher realized, it is necessary to give students many opportunities
throughout the day to share and explore ideas and bond together. Curriculum
is naturally a common subject of discussion:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>September came and all my children arrived. Events went very smoothly.
I felt I was meeting the needs of all my children. I breathed a sigh of
relief; all was going well. However, around the end of October I became
vaguely dissatisfied with the learning of my special needs child. She was
in my class, but was she truly a part of the class? Finally, I modified
all her subjects to fit in with the rest of the class; whatever we did,
she did.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had not been doing this because my special needs child had little or no
speech. When we all began doing the same subjects, she began to respond
to the other children, making more attempts to communicate verbally with
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I still wasn&#8217;t satisfied. Things were going well, but my special needs
child was still not interacting enough with other children. Also, some of
my other students were beginning to show very serious problems. They needed
more of my time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then one day in Woodstock I was introduced to cooperative learning. The
workshop was exiting. I felt that I had a partial solution to my problems
in the classroom. This strategy made sense. There are a lot of things you
need to learn about cooperative learning, but basically it is students
helping students strive toward an academic goal. Not only academic skills
but social skills are taught and evaluated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took awhile to set up the cooperative lessons, but when they began they
were exciting. The children were working together in groups, responsible
for their own learning as well as others&#8217; learning. It was amazing to see
children on their knees in their chairs, working through problems or
discussing different topics. Now it was really hard work to pick out my
special needs child.
She was part of the class, working along with the other children, sometimes
with an aide, sometimes with me, but mostly with the children. She was well
on her way to becoming independent as well as interdependent.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to using lessons to promote the development of relationships,
teachers have been creative in devising ways to weave support from other
professionals into the fabric of everyday classroom activities and student
routines (Giangreco, York and Rainforth, 1989).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through problem solving with other professionals, parents and peers,
teachers work towards physical and recreational goals in ways that, at
the same time, encourage the student&#8217;s inclusion in the mainstream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One teacher explained how Aidan, a student in Grade 5 who was seriously
injured in a car accident, is encouraged by his peers to use his right
hand to raise his weak left hand when he wants to ask a question or make
a comment to the teacher or his classmates. It takes him a little longer,
his teacher observes, but it is a natural way of practising the stretching
motion needed to maintain muscle tone in his weak arm. Classmates nearby
remind Aidan to sit up straight throughout the class by gently taping his
back when he forgets and slouches in his seat. His classmates know that
Aidan&#8217;s dream is to walk again and are thrilled to be able to help in any
way they can. One of his friends wrote:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When he said his biggest dreams are to be able to walk and drive a car,
I felt like jumping up and saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m with you all the way Aidan&#8221;,
because I want to help him. Is there any way I can help Aidan?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; McLaughlin<br>
<cite>1989</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>lf Aidan had been sent to therapy outside of the classroom for this exercise,
he would have missed the opportunity for peer encouragement and interaction
that being in the classroom afforded him (Giangreco, Edelman and Dennis, 1990).
His non-handicapped peers would have missed an opportunity to witness first-hand
Aidan&#8217;s determination and his struggle to regain his strength. Aidan
provided a good role model for his peers, and the teacher provided a
natural vehicle for peer relationship development&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the regular classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Outside the classroom, teachers, parents and other students can find ways
to involve the student in as many school activities as desired. Through
intramural activities, clubs and informal school groups, students with
disabilities have opportunities to become an integral part of the
recreational and social life of the school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They have the chance to form and maintain valuable peer relationships with
their non-handicapped schoolmates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Peer Tutoring</em></strong><br>
Another way teachers are encouraging students to form relationships while
assisting in each other&#8217;s learning is through peer tutoring. Teachers use
this strategy effectively in many learning situations throughout the school
day. The simplest approach is a system of peer partners who help each other
in a variety of ways: reviewing rote material; preparing for a spelling
test; learning math; or working together to correct each other&#8217;s assignments
and edit essays. Peer partners can help each other synthesize and assimilate
new material; for example, they can work together summarizing and sharing
key points in a text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers also use the peer partner system to motivate and encourage students
to try new things or to expand limited skills. One example we observed
involved a young student named Donnie in a Grade 4 classroom. Donnie sat
with a peer at a table. The peer was doing an exercise in his math notebook
while Donnie manipulated some plastic blocks placed on his desk by the
teacher. The peer used the blocks for assistance in solving equations while
Donnie used them to develop fine motor control, and to see and touch
number groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first, Donnie knocked the blocks off the table and his peer partner
bent and picked them up, arranging them in a pattern. Donnie ignored the
blocks. The peer picked up a block and showed Donnie how to open it. He
showed Donnie the small plastic toy inside. The peer encouraged Donnie to
pull open the block by himself. Donnie pushed the blocks away.
Donnie&#8217;s peer then took a Cheezie from a bag in his desk, showed it to
Donnie and hid it inside the block. Donnie struggled to open the block
and, when successful, ate the treat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The peer then showed him two blocks. &#8220;I have two blocks now, Donnie,&#8221;
he told him. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put the Cheezie in one of them.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8220;See if you can get it out.&#8221; In Donnie&#8217;s full view, the peer placed one
of the treats inside one of the blocks. Donnie chose the correct block
immediately, struggled to open it, and seized his prize. The game continued
for several minutes. As Donnie struggled to open the block each time, the
peer-carried on with his own work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The peer then took the two blocks and, holding them out of Donnie&#8217;s sight
under the desk, placed a Cheezie in one of the blocks and placed the two
blocks back on the table. Donnie tried to open the blocks as the peer
carried on with his work Donnie was successful and his peer gave him a smile
and a thumbs-up signal. Donnie smiled broadly as he enjoyed his prize.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Cross-Age Tutoring</em></strong><br>
Some teachers successfully employ cross-age tutors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;older students who
assist younger students with their work. Older students may read to their
young peers, listen to them read, or assist them with story writing or
math. Although this technique requires more time to set up because teachers
are needed to assist tutors in preparing activities and presentstion
strategies, teachers remark that the result is well worth the effort.
Tutoring gives older students the opportunity to analyze and think through
a particular skill or activity at a deeper level than they would ordinarily.
Teachers remark that students are often better than teachers at explaining
an idea or procedure because young people relate so well to one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cross-age tutoring also provides excellent opportunities for students who
are experiencing learning difficulties themselves to support and help other
schoolmates. The tutoring provides older students with opportunities to
practise certain lessons and to be on the giving side of a relationship
during school. Teachers using this technique remark on how it benefits the
tutors&#8217; self-esteem and how this feeling carries over into their general
self-confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Peer Modelling</em></strong><br>
Another powerful technique which requires less preparation than peer tutoring
is peer modelling. In this situation, a student models for another classmate
how to perform an activity or skill. For example, one student might show
his classmate with a disability how to use a pencil sharpener, play a
cassette player, or find his way to the next class. Sometimes, the teacher
first needs to model the procedure for the nondisabled student. Often,
however, students spontaneously initiate and devise clever ways to encourage
a peer to take part in a myriad of activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A high school computer teacher described how a capable student voluntarily
spent time in class with Todd, a nonverbal and overly timid classmate.
Todd was often observed standing back from the other students with his
arms held up tight amt his chest, wringing his hands. The student worked
with Todd, teaching him how to use a simple computer program. As weeks passed
and opportunities for exchanges between Todd and his computer partner were
maximized, Todd&#8217;s classmates noticed him showing more interest in communicating
with and being around other students and teachers during the day. He still
stood apart from his peers often, but he now exhibited a more relaxed body
posture. The speech pathologists and teachers then reviewed their efforts
to encourage Todd in his attempts to speak, identifying additional strategies
to build his new-found confidence. Meanwhile, the computer student was
challenged by her involvement with Todd. On her own, she designed several
other computer programs for him, which were later entered in the district
Science Fair.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_time_and_space_for_friendsships">CREATING TIME AND SPACE FOR FRIENDSSHIPS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who realize the importance of peer friendships for students with
disabilities capitalize on the many opportunities for interaction that
naturally arise during the course of the school day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They have learned that there is very little possibility for the formation
of relationships if students are not in close proximity to one another for
a reasonable length of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students who merely visit classrooms for short periods of time have less
chance of forming relationships than do those who spend the best part of
the day with other students. Teachers have argued that students who are
removed from the regular class for remediation frequently miss out on
important moments of the day. They question whether what is learned outside
the chlassroom is as valuable as what is missed. This has led classroom
teachers to collaborate with resource room teachers on devising ways to
incorporate individual instruction within the regular class structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Rubbing Elbows</em></strong><br>
Teachers are also finding that seating arrangements influence the opportunities
for students to interact with one another. Seating a student at the side
or back of the room, as often happens in order to accommodate the teacher&#8217;s
assistant, does not create the same proximity as seating the student with
a handicap in the midst of his peers. Having a student with a disability
in a position to rub elbows with the other students makes it more difficult
for the teacher and peers to inadvertently &#8220;overlook&#8221; him or her. A
close seating arrangement also provides natural opportunities for neighbouring
students to interact during the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of Patrick, a Grade 3 student who was unable to talk, the
teacher moved his desk from the side of the room where he sat with the
teacher assistant, to the middle of the second row. She observed that
students near him began to duplicate his communication gestures in order
to initiate an interaction with him. When he began to respond to their
initiations with smiles, squeals and gestures, the students were so excited
that their initiations escalated. They then began to invite him to be
partner in line as they got ready for class movement, recess and music.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They also began to run and
play with him in the playground at noon and recess time. This interaction
was made possible because the teacher realized that having Patrick off to
the side kept him apart and special, and placed barriers between him and
his classmates. The teacher also realized that having an adult between
Patrick and the students also created a barrier, so she instructed the
teacher assistant to move about the classroom and assist other students
as well. This illustration also points out the importance of reciprocity.
If Patrick had not responded in some way to the initiations of his peers,
their attempts at interaction would have diminished over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>A Means of Communicating</em></strong><br>
Teachers are now exploring ways of promoting communication among students
in the classroom. Non-disabled students are learning how to use communication
boards, gestures and signs, computerized devices and eye contact to help
students who are unable to talk to their peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One teacher gave a student who uses an adaptive device an opportunity to
teach her classmates about its unique characteristics. Mary, a senior
high school student who has multiple handicaps, uses her eyes and a
specially designed communication board to make her needs known. She made
a presentation to several high school classes about the organization of
her board and about how she used it to gain some control over her life.
Mary became the teacher for a time and, as a result of her lesson, the
students became interested in other forms of communicative devices. They
also were able to see Mary from a different perspective. She was no longer
a person of mystery, but another teenager with a unique way of talking to
her peers.
Her teacher had created a way to highlight Mary&#8217;s abilities and to show
that her desire to communicate her ideas and dreams was the same as that
of her fellow teens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Assigning Tasks</em></strong><br>
Patrick&#8217;s teacher also created ways for Patrick to assist his peers in
their work in order that he could reciprocate the assistance he received
from them. Each student had a personal notebook which they wrote in everyday.
The teacher pasted a picture of the owner on each notebook and Patrick,
who could not read, could then identify the picture, match the picture to
the person, and pass the notebooks out to his classmates. He was also able
to lend crayons and glue and other things he had in his desk to a classmate
who had learned to sign with him.
Not only was Patrick able to reciprocate conventional greetings and help
in the classroom, he was practising some of his individual academic goals
as well, which included signing, matching and student identification.
Behavioural goals such as moving quietly around the class and passing out
books without pushing, prodding or hitting were also being practised and
achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jane, a student in Grade 5 who could speak in short phrases but who could
not read or write, was involved in a Scrabble game the teacher devised to
assist students in practising spelling and vocabulary words. The teacher
explained to the group that Jane was allowed to place up to five letters
around an existing word on the gameboard even though she could not really
spell. The student to her right would ask her what word she had created
before tallying her score. In this way, Jane was involved in the vocabulary
of the classroom and she was expected to learn. She was also made a vital
part of the classroom culture because the curriculum became a vehicle to
highlight her thoughts and interests, which she revealed in the words she
chose. This set the stage for the development of friendships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher observed that Jane&#8217;s in-class relationships were carried over
into the playground. Even though Jane was fairly unstable on her feet, she
was invited to jump rope by the students in her class. Several of the
students demonstrated for her and then took great pains to make sure that
she got over the rope.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By slowing the rope down as it neared the ground, Jane could step over it
without becoming twisted in it and falling down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jane and the students kept count of her successful steps, and Jane&#8217;s turn
terminated when she failed to step cleanly over the rope. Then, much to
Jane&#8217;s surprise, she was required to swing the rope for the other players.
This also turned out to be an excellent form of physical therapy for Jane.
The relationship among the students had been fostered in the classroom by
the teacher&#8217;s skill in revealing the thoughts and interests of the students.
It has also been fostered by the teacher&#8217;s trust in the student&#8217;s ability
and willingness to adjust to one another after the first stages of the
relationship had been modelled and encouraged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Friendship Circles</em></strong><br>
People have found friendship circles (Snow and Forest, 1987) to be an
effective way of building relationships among children or young people.
To form a friendship circle, students who are interested in being involved
in the life of a fellow student are brought together on a team. With the
guidance of an interested and sensitive adult, these students help make
decisions and plans for and with the individual. They become involved with
the student on a personal basis both inside and outside the school. They
brainstorm ways of including the student in their own and other social
circles. They identify barriers that prevent the student from participating
in a particular setting or activity and then work together to break the
barriers down.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a &#8220;specialfriendsproject&#8221; or a &#8220;buddy system&#8221;
for &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; students, or a chance for students to do a good deed
for the day. The circle of friends is a network that allows for the genuine
involvement of children in a friendship, caring, and support role with
their peers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Circles meet regularly to plan outings and activities and to discuss the
things they have learned about themselves and others. Just as real friendships
grow, evolve and change, teachers have found that the composition and
personality of friendship circles change over time. This fluidity is expected
and allowed. Teachers involved in successful friendshipcircles are aware
of the natural ebb and flow of affection, attention and activity. They note,
however, that a core of students usually stays together for long periods
of time, which attests to the permanence and mutuality of the friendships
created.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers and parents voice their concern that, despite inschool successes,
a young person with a disability usually does not have &#8220;real friends&#8221;.
As one high school teacher summarized:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For all that Doug is involved in the life and activities of the school,
with all the friends and acquaintances he has here, after school he goes

anyone call.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Young<br>
<cite>1990</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both parents and teachers express dismay that outside school hours their
children and young people spend long inactive periods of time without
seeing anyone outside their immediate families or the paid professionals
in their lives. Isolation, loneliness and boredom are still realities for
many. When people with disabilities talk about their lives and what is
missing, they repeatedly point to the difficulty of building and maintaining
lasting friendships. They talk about the need to feel that their lives
touch others in important ways, and the need to know that their existence
makes a positive difference.
The physical and social barriers imposed by society, which for years
separated and devalued people with disabilities, are hard to break down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building ongoing friendships that extend outside school and into the
neighbourhood has been a challenge for teachers and families. Part of the
challenge is that friendship cannot be defined, analyzed, predicted or
assigned like school work.</p>

<p>Difficult as it is to define friendship, it is easy to describe why
friendships are important and how they enrich our lives.
They help us stretch beyond our families; they help children rehearse
adult roles; they are a haven from stress and they demystify strange and
inappropriate behaviour (Perske, 1988).

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Friendships expand our world and our perspectives; they are attractive
and generate their own energy; friendships are freely chosen and voluntary;
they are mutual and reciprocal, coming and going with intensity varying
over time. Friendships have their ups and downs, joys and pains, laughter
and tears (Pogrobin, 1987).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some teachers become discouraged and doubtful when searching for ways to
help a student with disabilities make friends. They feel that &#8220;real&#8221;
friendships cannot exist between disabled and non-disabled people and that
efforts to encourage friendships are staged and phoney.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In actual fact, adults can overlook or misinterpret relationships that
exist between disabled and non-disabled students.
We must he careful not to impose a stereotypical image of how friendships
should look and therefore devalue budding friendships that have non-traditional
features. There have been some remarkable friendships between disabled
and non-disabled students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers in one school were truly amazed to hear about a student&#8217;s efforts
to visit his friend with a disability who was in
the hospital struggling with a life-threatening condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two students had spent time together in school during noon hours and
they shared a few classes together. Although one of them had difficulty
speaking and often engaged in echolalia (the involuntary repetition of a
word or sentence just spoken by another person), the friends had obviously
found other ways to communicate their feelings, interests and thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some teachers had seen the relationship as one-sided and felt that the
non-disabled student was being charitable. When it was discovered that the
non-disabled student had hitchhiked fifty kilometres in the middle of a
Christmas cold snap, wearing only a light jacket with a broken zipper, to
see his friend in the hospital, the adults took the friendship more
seriously.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conclusion_6">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers who use the various strategies outlined above to encourage peer
relationships know that full integration will only occur when students
interact comfortably with one another both in school and in the community.
Since most of the hours of a student&#8217;s day are spent in school, teachers
can use curriculum and school activities as a vehicle to encourage and
maintain friendship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proximity and reciprocity are important in setting the stage for interactions.
In order for people to form relationships, they must be in the same place
for a reasonable length of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And if a student&#8217;s gestures of friendship are repeatedly ignored, he or she
may stop trying to interact. The onus is on the teacher to encourage students
with disabilities to respond and to inspire non-handicapped students to
persevere and search for responses which might otherwise be overlooked.
Eye and head movements, position changes, smiles and gestures are sometimes
the only way a person has of responding to his or her peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human beings present particular personality traits and
specific interests or skills which make them attractive to one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important for teachers to highlight these qualities in their daily
work with students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have witnessed relationships form and flourish in the classroom and,
in some cases, extend beyond the boundaries of the school. In order for
this to happen, interaction between students and relationship building
must be modelled and taught. Our experience shows that curriculum and
classroom activities provide the best opportunities for the elements of
peer relationships to fall naturally into place.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Brian Kelly and Jeff den Otter</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the integration of students with special needs has developed, people
have come to realize that, in order to be successful, an integrated
structure must he built on three components: physical factors, curricular
factors and social factors.
Social factors affecting strategies of inclusion are a unique challenge
and they need attention equal to that given to curricular and physical
concerns. In the following pages we describe the strategies used to
increase the social integration of a girl who has extremely challenging
behaviours. Her example illustrates the fact that effective intervention
strategies can improve the relationships and the lives of all children
with special needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sue">SUE</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the story of Sue, a young girl with special needs who had been
attending her neighbourhood school for four years. Even in a school
district with a five-year history of inclusion, Sue was considered an
exception because of her extremely challenging behaviours.
And despite the regular classroom setting, there
were concerns that her life differed too much from that of her peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Sue&#8217;s story illustrates that children with extremely challenging
behaviours can be fully integrated into the regular classroom. It is an
example of effective intervention strategies put in place to make a real
qualitative improvement in her relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In finding effective approaches for Sue we came to see that the strategies
became a spark which made people re-evaluate other people and their
capabilities. The strategies we chose were Supportive Peer Relations and
Gentle Teaching. Both of these involved inviting children and adults to
participate in the social inclusion of Sue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_supportive_peer_relationships">SUPPORTIVE PEER RELATIONSHIPS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Philosophy</em></strong><br>
In order for children to develop, they must be involved in relationships.
Through relationships they acquire, by direct learning and adoption of
social roles, the attitudes, values, roles, competencies, and ways of
perceiving the world that are shared by their families, schools and
communities. Children who are not involved in caring and supportive
relationships tend to become increasingly alienated and disconnected from
people and activities in their families, schools and societies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fostering peer relationships is one means of promoting meaningful
interdependence. Peer relationships can provide feelings of support,
belonging, acceptance and caring. They give the opportunity to acquire
appropriate social roles, and they provide the sensitivity required to
build and maintain meaningful relationships. They enable the internalization
of values, attitudes, perspectives and goals needed for responsible
decision-making and long-term friendships that will provide assistance in
adult life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our schools and homes there has been a relative neglect of constructive
child-to-child relationships. There is often an adult-centric perspective
in which adults are seen as the only
people who can support and nurture children who are lonely, challenging
or in difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, Brendtro and Ness (1983) discussed this phenomenon in schools
and the perceived monopoly by adults:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The increasing sophistication of human service professionals has given
rise to a myth and the belief that only those with high degrees of training
can be effective in teaching or treatment. Although it is commendable that
the emerging professions have sought to improve the qualifications of
practitioners, this emphasis has sometimes obscured the reality that young
people can, and usually do, have more influence on one another than do
adults.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facilitating peer relationships requires building and maintaining supportive
and caring relationships in which the person is valued as a separate and
unique individual, regardless of the perceived special need. Having friends
who value appropriate behaviour and behave as competent role models is
essential for most children, adolescents and young adults. In contrast,
being isolated from peers is one of the major symptoms of psychological
distress. Psychological distress can be the result of isolation (i.e.,
streaming students) or it can cause the isolation (i.e., students who
become lonely because of a lack of social skills). Influencing the peer
group may be one of the most important actions adults can take to ensure
that children who are distressed have an opportunity to become successful
and competent members of their peer groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Children with disabilities typically have not had the opportunity to
experience or develop a range of social relationships with their peers:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>as a result, they spend inordinate amounts of time in solitary activities;
they spend excessive amounts of time with adult family members and paid
caregivers who
almost become unnaturally intrusive in their lives.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Brown et al<br>
<cite>1989</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a group of peers does not include a child with a disability in their
relationships, adults usually take responsibility for replacing the peer
group. But adults are inappropriate role models. What is work for adults
is normal activity for children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The regular classroom is an important place for healthy, inclusive peer
relationships to develop. Children who are disabled need support in
developing relationships, and nondisabled children need support in
accepting their peers who have disabilities. Teachers can play a key role
in ensuring that these relationships develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Involving the Children</em></strong><br>
There is a reewakening interest in using students as a positive influence
on the behaviour or learning of their peers. Adults are usually surprised
to discover that children are capable of performing many functions that
were once thought to be the exclusive province of adults. Giving youth
more responsibility in our schools is an untapped resource that offers
great potential for innovation. Research on instructional strategies such
as cooperative learning and peer tutoring has demonstrated the advantages
of making students more responsible for mutual learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another means of facilitating peer interdependence and responsibility is
to have students, as a group, intentionally make a commitment to help a
peer with special needs. This recently developed form of structured peer
involvement has come to be known as a peer support group or &#8220;circle of
friends&#8221; (Perske and Perske, 1988).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_aspects_of_sue_s_alienation">ASPECTS OF SUE&#8217;S ALIENATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Behavioural Barriers</em></strong><br>
At the time of our involvement, Sue was a twelve-year-old girl in Grade 5.
She attended a junior high school in a small, rural town. Sue was fortunate
in many respects. She had been in an integrated school since kindergarten
and she lived at home with her family. Her teachers made efforts to
identify her individual needs and to provide supports and resources so
that she could prosper within her classroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Still, Sue&#8217;s schooling had a history of challenges. Sue was known as a
person who had an inclination to hurt others by matching, kicking or
hitting. She was sometimes self-abusive and, at times, engaged in
self-stimulating behaviours. Sue&#8217;s behaviours prevented her from taking
part in meaningful social activities and real learning situations. They
also got in the way of any natural interactions that Sue might have had
with her peers or with adults.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Few people understood the communicative function of Sue&#8217;s behaviour. Her
outbursts or temper tantrums were seen as the behaviour of a person who
was different, or as a symptom of her disobedience or lack of control.
Factors such as her behaviour, and the school&#8217;s fear of injury to other
students and disruption to the class, led to measures which kept her from
her peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an attempt to help her cope, Sue was given an aide. She was often seen
with her aide, studying during class time or playing solitary games during
recess or lunch. Someone was always close by keeping an eye on her. Sue
was being looked after, but rarely was there any interaction between
herself and her teacher or her neighbouring peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having an aide for Sue was a mixed blessing. Over the short term, the aide
was helping to deal with immediate concerns such as Sue&#8217;s tutoring,
general welfare and behaviour. But over the long term, the aide&#8217;s presence
seemed to further distance Sue from those around her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cyclical pattern
began to emerge where Sue&#8217;s behaviour required support, than the support
alienated Sue further from her peers, which escalated the intensity of her
outbursts, which required tighter measures, which further alienated her,
and so on.
It became evident that while Sue attended her neighbourhood school with
her regular peers, she was alone; her life paralleled the lives of her
peers but rarely intersected with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Factors in the School Structure</em></strong><br>
The school environment was also a factor in her lack of friendship. The
school was perceived as a place where Sue was to learn new skills and
demonstrate appropriate behaviour while in a learning environment. These
are important objectives for all students. However, for Sue, these skills
and behaviours were being taught without the benefit of friendships to
provide the impetus, motivation or relevancy needed to make them seem
important or desirable to her.
When children work or play with one another, they imitate each other&#8217;s
behaviour and identify with friends possessing admired competencies or
skills. As a result, they provide each other with powerful models of
appropriate and inappropriate behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our schools seem to play down the importance of peer relationships, which
are mainly relegated to extracurricular activities. In most classrooms,
students work alone, doing seatwork or listening to the teacher&#8217;s
instruction. Students&#8217; attempts to interact in groups are considered
disruptive to the learning environment. Similarly, there is no instruction
in the social skills necessary for interacting effectively with peers.
These skills have not been considered pedagogically useful for learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much of this can be attributed to the way our schools have been set up.
Until quite recently schools have been institutions where skills were
learned in a rigid, assembly-line fashion. The teachers role was to
impart knowledge to the students.
Similarly, there were clearly defined roles for other school
personnel; for example, teacher&#8217;s aides are clearly distinguished from
attendants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current educational philosophy supports the need for interaction and
collaboration&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not only between students but between students and school
personnel as well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in order for meaningful learning to occur. According
to Skrtic (1988) the school in seen as an "adhocracy" where collaboration
among all staff and students results in students learning facts as well
as social skills, problem solving and creative thinking.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sue_s_support_group">SUE&#8217;S SUPPORT GROUP</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Talking to Sue&#8217;s Class</em></strong><br>
To include Sue as a member of her class required the acceptance and efforts
of her homeroom teacher, classmates and school. Sue&#8217;s teacher voiced the
concern that his other students would lose out through their efforts to
help Sue. He saw student involvement as something that would take away
from their academic and extracurricular time. Also from a more traditional
viewpoint, the need for student participation was considered unnecessary
because the teacher&#8217;s aide had been hired to fulfil the school&#8217;s and Sue&#8217;s
needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We held a class meeting as the first step in involving Sue&#8217;s peers. We
began by sensitizing them to what integration is and why it is in everyone&#8217;s
best interest to include students with special needs in our classrooms,
schools and communities. We discussed the fact that, only seven years ago,
students with needs similar to Sue&#8217;s were sent away from their families
or were educated in separate classrooms or were given no education.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One student spoke up and said that she had &#8220;an uncle who was mentally
handicapped&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;he&#8217;s older now and harder to handle. That&#8217;s why Sue needs
our help now.&#8221; It quickly became apparent that Sue&#8217;s classmates already
knew why they should include her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We asked the students if they thought Sue now belonged
to their class. Unanimously, they indicated that she did not, but that
she was someone who spent a lot of time in the resource room. When asked
how they thought they could start including Sue, one boy said, &#8220;Saying
hello in the morning.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We asked,&#8220;What sort of things do you think Sue
likes to do outside in the playground?&#8221; The children said, &#8220;Climbing,
piggybacking, swinging, slidingng, playing with Puppets, having other
people besides her aide or teacher with her.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We asked what things the students could do in the classroom with Sue.
They said, &#8220;Learning her numbers and letters, cutting things out, crafts,
picture cards, puzzles.&#8221; We questioned them on activities Sue could do
with them and they replied, &#8220;Read, help her with her work, read to her,
draw with her, have one of us with her each day, write on the blackboard.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When invited to help Sue with these activities, all but two of the
children volunteered to help. We stressed during the meeting that they
were not to feel pressured into helping but that if they wanted to make
the commitment, they should consider it to last the whole school year.
We picked six students arbitrarily to help support Sue at school. Within
a few days of the meeting, it was apparent that these students had
commitments which sometimes took them away from Sue. If students were
going to help her, it would require all the children in the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We worried about initiating this process because, while we were committed
to the group, we were responsible for maintaining safety and order in the
school. Sue was known to strike out at those around her. With the other
children in Sue&#8217;s class, we discussed their ability to identify Sue&#8217;s
signs of anger. The students spoke of ways to deflate a potential incident
and to minimize the chances of getting hurt, and of what to do if they
felt things were getting out of hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the students admitted that they found it upsetting when Sue got
out of control. Twenty-one of the twenty-five students indicated that they
were concerned about her anger but didn&#8217;t want to change their commitment
to Sue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a follow-up to our planning session, a note went to parents commending
their child for supporting a student in their class. We had an ulterior
motive for sending the note. We anticipated some resistance from parents,
given Sue&#8217;s history within the community. Moreover, we wanted to
communicate that this was something which the school valued and which was
important as part of the regular curriculum. In the note, parents were
asked that if they had any concerns about their child&#8217;s participation
they should contact the school. Not one parent phoned to indicate that
they had any concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later in the year, I asked a few students how their parents felt about
them helping Sue when it was known that she could hurt others. They told
me that their parents told them &#8220;to be careful&#8221; and &#8220;to just watch out.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of our support to the students we felt it important to give them
an opportunity to discuss on a routine basis how things were going. We
usually met in the cafeteria at lunchtime for these discussions and Sue
usually joined us. The talk never focused on Sue unless the students were
asked direct questions about how things were going. Right from the first
meeting we could see that it was intuitive for the students to include
Sue but it required leadership on our part to get it started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Advocacy and Growth Among the Students</em></strong><br>
As groups usually do, this one took on a personality of its own over the
weeks. One of the interesting developments was the emergence of leaders.
Kerri Ann, even at her young age, made astute observations about Sue&#8217;s
program and seemed to instigate many positive changes. For example, Kerri
noted that the aide or teachers didn&#8217;t seem to be giving Sue enough
independence. She said that as Sue&#8217;s support group gained confidence they
wanted to take more responsibility for Sue during certain classes such as
gym, library or free time. They wanted to play with Sue alone in the
school yard, or go to the library and read to her and see if she would
reciprocate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She asked why Sue
could not take French, commenting that &#8220;all we do in French is repeat
words&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Sue can do that.&#8221; Her observations had an underlying truth which
few adults could explain away or discount. Consequently, Sue had
opportunities to participate in activities which adults would have
considered irrelevant or in conflict with her program. For instance, Sue
previously had to miss French so that she would have extra time to get
ready to go home on the bus. Kerri felt that Sue was as able as any
student to get ready in the allotted ten minutes. And, given the
opportunity, Sue was able.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another student, Scott, also became Sue&#8217;s advocate. He seemed to be more
in tune with Sue&#8217;s needs than other peers.
Over the year, he went from being a volunteer to being truly fond of Sue.
His commitment to support Sue turned into a friendship. For Scott, the
experiences around helping Sue enlarged his vision of friendship and
expended his active contribution to the school community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some students, being in the support group provided them with a
relationship which compensated for some absence in their lives. Each of
us has primary relationships with parents or siblings which are a major
source of nurturing, love and acceptance. Some students, because of
divorce, alcohol abuse, or other situations, have had terrible
experiences with some significant relationships. These students often
become lonely and attention-seeking. This was the situation for some of
the students in Sue&#8217;s peer group; they were eager to overcome their
limited success with meaningful relationships and become involved again.
This seemed to spark their interest in Sue&#8217;s group. Over time, other
students found the group comfortable to be in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commitment made by students generally seen as loners and troublemakers
surprised teachers. One teacher said, &#8220;I would never believe that this
person would ever volunteer to help.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Changes in Sue&#8217;s Life</em></strong><br>
Sue&#8217;s peers were not the only ones to change over the year. Sue&#8217;s life
changed as well. She went from being alone to having a group of peers who
cared about what she was doing every day and who actively participated in
making her life better. Sue went from living without many meaningful
social interactions to being involved in active friendships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One student told a story about Sue sharing something she enjoyed. Sue had
gone over to this particular student, put her arm around her, and directed
her over to where she was listening to some music. The student said, &#8220;At
the first of the year she did not want me around her. Now she actually
enjoys seeing me.&#8221; Another student spoke of the changes in Sue. &#8220;She
has calmed down. I knew her when she was in kindergarten. She has now
learned how to treat other people.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the some time, there were difficulties over the year. Kevin spoke of
Sue coming over to him and hitting him in the face. When we sat and talked
about the incident, he shrugged and said, &#8220;I was at the wrong place at
the wrong time.&#8221; I had expected this experience to frighten him away but
it didn&#8217;t seem to deter him from resolving to be with Sue. We learned
later from his parents that because of Kevin&#8217;s acceptance of Sue they did
not contact the school about the incident. Previously, this incident
would have called into question whether or not Sue would have been allowed
to stay in the school. Having a peer advocate for her changed the parent&#8217;s
perception of the seriousness of the incident. In turn, the parents did
not demand that the school mediate the situation. The bonds of friendship
brought out Sue&#8217;s positive attributes which made the student want to
mediate on her behalf. If she was identified only as a hitter or a kicker
the student may have wanted the school to deal with the behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We came to realize that before the students became involved, Sue&#8217;s
behaviour would have resulted in students staying away from her while
adults intervened. It became obvious that peers, by becoming involved,
looked past her
behaviour to see her as a person who had a bad temper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the year progressed students, instead of moving away from Sue when she
was angry, drew close. When Sue was frustrated with work, they would
provide encouragement. When she was angry they would stand near her. They
had learned that being close helped her and, as one student joked, &#8220;If
she went to hit you, she couldn&#8217;t hit as hard in close.&#8221; Consequently,
it was not unusual to see a group of kids around Sue as they walked the
busy corridors to their next class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the year, we interviewed some of the students who had been
with Sue. From these discussions some common themes emerged:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The students liked making a commitment to Sue. Out of the twenty-five
students who started, only two left the group. The students in the
support group saw students who were not in the group as outsiders. When
asked if they felt it was a job they had to do, students replied, &#8220;No,
it wasn&#8217;t. We were doing something for her,&#8221; and &#8220;No, it was like being
with anyone else in the class&#8221;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They felt that they were contributors to Sue and their class. Students
felt they were not asked often enough to help other students in school.
&#8220;We could do a lot more if we were given the chance,&#8221; one student said.
&#8220;My mother says that I am good with other kids. It&#8217;s something that I
already have.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the students derived satisfaction from their relationship with
Sue. Her peers described the experience as &#8220;fun because you get to laugh
with Sue about things.&#8221;
Another student drew satisfaction from the experience, saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s
nice when she says your name.&#8221; Students commented on feeling bad when
they were away from school or had other commitments which prevented them
from being with Sue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="4">
<li>
<p>Students got to know others better. Initially, the group came together
to help Sue but in the process they got to know each other better. For
instance, at first Scott described Eric as a goof and the class clown.
But as they spent time together because of Sue, he came to see that Eric
was actually quite serious.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_guideline_for_developing_peer_groups">GUIDELINE FOR DEVELOPING PEER GROUPS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peer groups are as unique as the individual students in them. There is
no one way of forming groups, but here are some points worth
consideration:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Students need to be asked to participate in solving problematic
situations. They quickly learn to become passive in an adult-centred world
which tries to solve all their problems for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The class may need to be involved in discussions and reach a consensus
that there is a problem for one of the students. For someone with special
needs it could be an issue of inclusion. For the at-risk student it could
be strategies to help the student attend classes. For the student who
just moved to the school it can be how to make them feel welcome. By
discussing and comparing prior experiences to the current problematic
situations, students will come to see that they already know solutions.
For example, students can be encouraged to examine how a stranger is made
welcome in their home. In the process of decreasing the gap between the
way things are and the way they should be, children come up with rich
alternate strategies.
This process brings out values of equity that the children know about but
may never have acted on before. It provides the peer group with a rationale
and may benefit all students who lack adequate peer support and inclusion,
not just the student in question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li>
<p>There should he a facilitator (generally a teacher) who helps coach
students along. In building intentional communities, another term for
support groups, John McNight (cited in O&#8217;Connell, 1988) calls this person
a guide. This is the key person who helps pull things together. The guide
is not a director and is not more important than other group members but
is someone to help the group put their ideas into practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group may need to meet regularly. This can be at lunch or at a
special outing. The purpose of the meetings is to structure the group
enough, at the beginning, to encourage a sense of unity and a spirit of
interaction. The meetings are a forum where people get to know one
another better; the group then provides an opportunity to break the
rigidity of existing peer cliques and to form new relationships. When
people become accustomed to meeting they will continue, generally with
little encouragement or direction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_gentle_teaching_in_the_classroom">GENTLE TEACHING IN THE CLASSROOM</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Total inclusion in Sue&#8217;s school meant that, at some level, everyone in
her school interacted with her. Students, through the peer group, were
developing friendships with Sue, but most adults were uncomfortable
working directly with Sue because of her challenging behaviour. As a
result, only a few people who had &#8220;ways of dealing with her&#8221; had
developed a relationship with her. Given her challenging behaviour, they
were perceived as having some special ability. We needed to give adults
a way to develop good relationships with her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We chose Gentle Teaching (McGee et al, 1987), which presented a set of
common strategies to facilitate meaningful dialogue between Sue and those
who worked with her in the school. It enabled people to work with Sue to
control and redirect her challenging behaviour, which in turn improved
their relationships with her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dr. John McGee proposed the use of Gentle Teaching as a non-aversive
technique for dealing with people who exhibit challenging behaviours. He
was brought to Canada by The Roeher Institute to provide alternative
approaches to punishment used and accepted in the past to curtail
aggressiv and self-injurious behaviour. These included the use of cattle
prods, noxious substances, and physical and mechanical restraints. Gentle
Teaching focuses on three main assumptions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A human being has inherent value that is not contingent upon
productivity or behaviour;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person&#8217;s participation with another person has value that is not
linked to, nor contingent upon, the person&#8217;s ability to complete a
structured task;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human interaction is reciprocal in nature and people can be taught a
process of reciprocity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These assumptions are based upon the idea of bonding and friendship that
is typified by trust and security. McGee sees bonding and friendship as
the bases for a relationship between a person and the caregiver. It is
through our relationships with others that we work past a person&#8217;s
challenging behaviour.
Our desire for changing a person&#8217;s behaviour is secondary to the care
and respect we have to show for the individual. Developing a trusting
relationship is specific to each person and the relationship is not
transferable to other caregivers. Each caregiver must make his own bond
with the person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We attended a week-long workshop in Nova Scotia on Gentle Teaching and
began to think that Sue could benefit from this alternative approach. It
was our hope that by offering a workshop at the school, and by involving
the people closely associated with Sue, we might he able to get beyond
Sue&#8217;s agressive behaviour to a point where we could establish meaningful
interactions with her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Developing Techniques in a Workshop</em></strong><br>
Our workshop format was modelled after the one in Nova Scotia. A room
was designated as the workshop room and for five days Sue, her mother,
the teacher, the principal, the teacher&#8217;s assistants, the collaborating
teacher, next year&#8217;s collaborating teacher and two school district office
consultants assembled and practised together. We began each day by
discussing the theory and strategies that are an integral part of Gentle
Teaching. Then we planned our agenda for the day, with objectives: how to
teach Sue that she was safe with us; that being with us was rewarding and
that interacting with us was more enjoyable than driving us away through
physical aggression.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first, the task seemed overwhelming. We needed to convince the teachers
that we had something valuable to offer them in terms of changing Sue&#8217;s
situation at school. For the participants, it was difficult to imagine
how people could work together when they had different responsibilities
and different expectations of what Sue could do. In addition, they were
asked to change the way in which they dealt with Sue. This group was not
there strictly by choice; they were required to take part. They were
being videotaped and assessed by their peers, a process unfamiliar and
intimidating to most of them.
The workshop would take a week and some people felt this was excessive
and unfair to other students who also required attention. How could we
justify spending so much time, energy and money on one student?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the videotape of the first morning&#8217;s session, during which time we
asked people to interact with Sue as they would normally, we were able to
discern some of the typical patterns of interaction. Foremost, those who
worked with Sue focused on the successful completion of academic tasks.
Verbal exchanges with her included encouragement and giving directions
and praise for correct responses. Eye contact was minimal and very much
task-oriented. Sue, on the other hand, almost always led the activity,
doing what she wanted with a given task or material, or refusing to do a
task by turning from
it or the person, or by escaping to a far corner of the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She said,
&#8220;No,thank you&#8221; or &#8220;Excuse me, please&#8221; to block attempts to engage her
in an activity. When these attempts failed, Sue used physical aggression
to avoid unwanted interactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When changing from one activity to another, Sue almost always ran away
from her teachers, and bringing her back meant a physical struggle. Sue
would often climb on furniture to the highest point she could reach so
that interaction was almost imposible or became a confrontation. She also
talked to interrupt and avoid the activity. Sue&#8217;s attention span was
perceived to be short, so that planned activities were usually simple,
fast, and changed often.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our first task,then, was to decide how we as a group were going to change
the way we worked with Sue so as to bring about the change we wanted&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;her willingness to participate in a task. We made several decisions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Tasks would be simple one- or two-step procedures that were not
necessarily academic in nature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each task would encourage Sue to orient herself with the person helping
her in the activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbal praise and encouraging touches would begin as soon as the
activity began and end only when the task was completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Sue hesitated to engage in the activity, the adult would begin the
activity and help Sue participate by placing the materials in her hand;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The materials used would be solid objects which could be passed easily
from one person to another and which were available in large quantities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The activity would take place wherever Sue happened to be. Having
interaction with Sue was most important;
where it took place in the classroom was secondary. Should she go to the
other side of the room, the materials would he easily transported to her
and that is where the teaching would take place;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="7">
<li>
<p>If Sue should hit us as we attempted to engage her, we would protect
ourselves by blocking the hits, but no outward attention would be given
to the behaviour. We would continue to interact and resume the
value-giving, the touches, and the praise with the activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was not enough only to give value to Sue, it was important that she
learn to reciprocate value to us. Interactions needed to be mutually
rewarding. Therefore, gestures such as handsakes and &#8220;high fives&#8221; would
be solicited from Sue periodically throughout the activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The room arrangement would be altered to cut down on places where Sue
could get away from us, and to decrease the number of opportunities to
escape interaction. We hoped that by altering the physical layout of the
room we would increase the chances of interaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main objectives were decided upon, based on all of the above
strategies. Complex tasks which required a great deal of attention were
simplified, as the attention required to complete these tasks precluded
interaction between Sue and the person working with her. The rate and the
animation of the praise given needed to be increased, to impress the
message that she was safe and secure with us. The words spoken to her
were to give her reason to look at us and anticipate our next action,
which would keep the momentum of the interaction going. As previously
mentioned, we had to arrange the classroom in a more organized fashion.
Unused materials needed to be put away, the furniture needed to be
arranged to inhibit her climbing, and we had to pay attention to her
tendency to run out of the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These strategies were to enable caregivers to interact with Sue and avoid
punishing her. They are not new strategies; they are time-tested
approaches that have been used by caregivers for years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new approaches were tested and the group felt that they had
accomplished what they had set out to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They were able to able to establish a valuing relationship with Sue and
decrease the frequency of her aggressive outbursts. In addition, the
amount of time spent in positive interaction after the workshop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some concerns and questions arose during the workshop. A few people were
concerned that we were pushing Sue beyond the limits of her endurance.
Initially the valuing was too animated and therefore seemed artificial.
The energy required to bring about participation was too great. In
addition, the group asked: how meaningful were the activities? Had we
eliminated her aggression to the degree hoped for? How would we do Gentle
Teaching in the classrom?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>The Transition to the Classroom</em></strong><br>
We had worked with Sue in a setting separate from the classroom, using
normal voices and plenty of activity and enthusiasm. Some participants
thought that using Gentle Teaching in the classroom would be disruptive
and intrusive.
However, others argued that past behaviour-management programs, such as
taking Sue to time-out, had been disruptive.
Despite the doubts, most participants felt that working preventively to
establish relationships would, over the long term, lessen the likelihood
of disruptions, as opposed to simply reacting and trying to control her
outbursts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some attention was paid to the setup of the classroom. If classrooms were
going to be controlled environments where students sat in rows facing the
teacher and were quiet most of the time, than any intervention was going
to be a distraction to the class. If classrooms were places where students
interacted with each other, then disruption would be less obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Activities during the workshop were geared to Sue&#8217;s interests and abilities.
After the workshop these or similar activities were adapted and used in
the daily routine in class.
The materials and methods in the training sessions were only a starting
point for participation; novel and more complex materials needed to be
introduced as soon as meaningful interactions were established.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contrived activities had to be
replaced by activities more academically suited and ageappropriate for
the learning of particular students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One example of how Gentle Teaching strategies could be used in natural
situations was given by the methods and resource teacher, an in-school
consultant to other teachers
<a href="#_chapter_8">(see Chapter 8)</a>
.
When Sue began self-stimulating behaviours the teacher took Sue and two
of her peers and began to throw a ball around in a simple game of catch.
Sue was valued and redirected from her self-stimulation. This was Gentle
Teaching, although at the time the teacher did not recognize it as such.
It was a preventive approach rather than a reactionary one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a danger that Gentle Teaching may be seen only as a response to
inappropriate behaviour if it is viewed narrowly as a behaviour modifcation
technique. Gentle Teaching, however, is broader than this. It is an
educational approach that should be embedded in the daily interactions
between teacher and students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In retrospect, a one-week investment in developing a new process to deal
with students was not excessive, particularly considering the time and
resources spent on Sue&#8217;s challenging behaviour over the years. And if the
process worked for Sue, there was a possibility that it would work for
other students in her school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The school developed a cadre of people who were familiar with the process
and who could teach their colleagues. It was necessary and beneficial that
the principal participated in the process for its continuation in the
school. Principals are the educational leaders and typically have great
influence on school practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A follow-up meeting was planned one week after the workshop. Knowing that
this was the first time Gentle Teaching was presented in an educational
setting, we felt a need to regroup and discuss how things were going and
to address some concerns. The teachers reported that:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Sue was talking more in her daily interactions with the
teacher;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p>Generally, there was more eye contact;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sue was  more interactions with her peers, and making efforts to share
things with others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sue was trying to imitate other students;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sue was smiling more often and more spontaneously than before;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rate of aggression had not changed significantly, but the duration
and the intensity of her agressive behaviour had lessened;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sue had a less glassy-eyed look when she interacted or worked at her
lessons. She appeared to be more in touch with what was going on around
her.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sue&#8217;s mother also pointed out that:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Sue was talking much more at home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She participated in skiing, a sport that she was unfamiliar with, and
enjoyed herself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was more cooperative and less belligerent around the house.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although most observations reported at the meeting were positive, there
were some concerns raised:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Sue was slapping at people even though this behaviour had not been
exhibited for a time prior to the Gentle Teaching workshop;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A month before the workshop, Sue refused to go to the cafeteria to ??est.
At the time of the meeting Sue was still eating her lunch in the
classroom, rather than in the cafeteria with her peers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sue had attempted to bite adults in the resource room.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conclusion_7">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many questions still to be addressed, but it is an ongoing
process. We have learned to examine how we do things and discuss new
strategies to cope with the situations that arise over the school year.
This contrasts with our expectations of last year when we thought we
would somehow fix Sue. We acknowledge that she has behaviours that might
change, but will not disappear; on the other hand, the supports in place
make her behaviours less frightening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we are to make changes that support the existence of a variety of
learning styles and abilities within a single classroom, we have to be
prepared to change our notions about what is and is not feasible within
our classrooms. Gentle Teaching is one method of dispelling the mystique
that surrounds problem behaviours. We feel that this strategy is
compatible with our philosophy of equity and respect for all students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gentle Teaching is an attitudinal stance, but is deeply rooted in good
teaching techniques, which involve ensuring success with each learning
task as well as full participation and involvement. It is our contention
that the process of integration, the changes in methodology needed to
nurture it such as inclusion, collaboration, multi-level instruction, and
cooperative learning, and the Gentle Teaching philosophy are naturally
supportive of one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two approaches used with Sue, Supportive Peer Relationships and
Gentle Teaching, have fostered the social inclusion of this most
challenging youngster in the regular classroom. They have given her the
opportunity for interdependence with her peers and a richer lifestyle
than most children like Sue have because of their actions. It is
important for her to have friends, rather than being a lonely person
defined solely in terms of her behaviour. Similarly, we have increased
the network of people who can work with Sue and with each other&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;teachers,
peers and parents. In return, Sue has empowered us by increasing our
competency. She has shown
us that change is possible and that schools can do more to embrace
children regardless of their needs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Melanie Panitch</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The drive to develop integrated post-secondary education is part of a
historical and continuing struggle to include people with disabilities
in their natural communities with full rights of citizenship. They have
the same needs as everyone else to further their education, to enhance
their personal competencies and to contribute to society. Post-secondary
education is one of the means by which their needs can be met.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in many ways both subtle and overt, some students have been
told that they don&#8217;t belong on campus.
College and university courses and programs were, until very recently,
completely overlooked as potential opportunities for persons with a
mental handicap. This lack of expectation has repercussions. When the
situation does arise that a person has an opportunity to select courses,
the act of choosing becomes a problem because the person likely has never
been asked to think about what he or she wants to do after high school.
Career councelling is not available to all students in secondary school
and certain students are not among the targeted group that colleges and
universities work to attract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dr. Oliver Sachs, well known for his landmark work,
<em>Awakenings</em> (1982), documented the 1988 students&#8217; strike at Gallaudet
University in Washington, the world famous liberal arts college for the
deaf. In March of that year, when the presidential vacancy was about to
be filled, the students campaigned to have the first deaf president in
the school&#8217;s 124 year history. According to Sachs&#8217; eye-witness account,
in selecting the only hearing candidate and ignoring the depth of
conviction on this issue, the authorities were amused of being
paternalistic, of holding values based on an implicit view of incompetence
and of appearing to believe &#8220;that deaf people should be printers, or
work in the post office, do &#8216;humblejobs&#8217; and not aspire to higher
education&#8221; (Sachs, 1989).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite these attitudes, inclusive post-secondary education is making
headway in Canada. A community college in Toronto, a university in
Edmonton and a CEGEP(community college) in Montreal have been including
students with mental handicaps for several years now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was Coordinator of the Humber College Community Integration through
Cooperative Education (CICE) program in Toronto, Ontario, from 1984 to
1990. The program was designed to support educational opportunities at
college for individuals with a mental handicap&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the people for whom the
college doors had previously been shut.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As coordinator of the new program, I was immersed in the ideology and
culture of the college, learning about its history and values, and
listening to the language of education. I became convinced that these
students truly belonged there.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_humber_program_a_step_on_the_continuum_of_integration">THE HUMBER PROGRAM: A STEP ON THE CONTINUUM OF INTEGRATION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A walk through Humber College on any given day reveals a noisy, animated
and colourful scene. Private conversations compete with aspiring DJs on
the student radio station. A preponderance of denim, T-shirts and leather
set the overall fashion tone. French fries and Diet Coke provide daily
sustenance to many of the 9,000 full-time day students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simulated hospital wards, greenhouses, computer centres, a new technology
wing, music practice studios, even a morgue leave a lasting impression
of the opportunities for learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Very much a part of this activity are students supported by CICE every
year. The fact that they are there is due to the efforts of one
persistent parent who strongly believe that his son and all other
children had the right to continue their education once they had
completed high school. He lobbied, wrote proposals, convened meetings
and eventually succeeded in wounding the college to test the waters in
1984.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, the eighteen students are supported by three faculty members, and
by students on field placement, volunteers and peer tutors. As part of
the admission procedure, applicants indicate their interests and are
connected with the college program best representing what they would like
to learn. A person who likes children could be linked with Early Childhood
Education; a sports fan might find like-minded students in the Recreation
Leadership Program; an interest in wood-working could lead to the
Cabinet-Making Program.
There is also an Audio-Visual Technicians program and a Cosmetic
Management comes. One student who uses a small computer to communicate
found a natural fit in the Journalism Program; another applicant said her
goal in coming to college was to work as a volunteer in a hospital; she
went into Nursing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>A Place for Acceptance</em></strong><br>
These students are integrated into the complete two-year program which
they follow throughout their attendance at the college. They pay regular
tuition fees for which they receive student cards, library privileges
and access to the athletics centre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are students of Humber College in every sense. They identify
themselves, as do all students, by program (&#8220;I&#8217;m taking Hospitality&#8221;),
and their friends are the students engaged in the same pursuit, sharing
timetables and deadline pressures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are so proud of being part of the school that trips to the book
store to purchase binders, sweatshirts, and knapsacks bearing the Humber
logo are as frequent as finances will allow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being at a community college or university has multiple benefits to a
person&#8217;s self-esteem. Colleges and universities are socially valued
environments because the pursuit of higher education is regarded so
positively in our society. The power of belonging to a valued place in
the comunity goes far beyond the support provided by a teacher or the
knowledge gained in a course. It creates a positive mood for learning and
the value of the environment is transmitted to students, who often convey
an entirely new sense of personal bearing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adult education, particularly, is by nature an accepting environment.
Society has a healthy respect for the experiences that have made up a
person&#8217;s life by the time they reach adulthood. The experience of life
with a disability has a claim on that respect; and, while allowances are
being made in adult education programs for disabilities, the challenges
and expectations of the educational environment prepare students for life
off-campus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers of adult education often see their profession as a continuum
which incorporates all people who want to learn.
The best teachers will argue that they are less interested in teaching
content to students than in encouraging them to consider themselves as
agents in the process of learning. The teachers impart to students that
learning how to learn rather than devouring a body of text will better
prepare them for life in a rapidly changing society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More and more, teachers are using a combination of teaching strategies
to accommodate students&#8217; different learning styles. Lecture style works
best for those who like to take notes or record information for review
purposes; audio visual aids help theme who need to &#8220;see&#8221; the main
points; group discussions are useful for those who need to exchange ideas
to grasp them; and field trips or work placements are essential for those
who need hands-on learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these learning styles are effective for
people who learn at a slower pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Adapting the System to the Student</em></strong><br>
Through CICE, there is considerable work done to modify and adapt the
course to each student. And students are provided with support to go to
class for as long as they want that support. Central to the role of the
CICE faculty members is collaboration with other students and instructors
so that major points of the course can be highlighted, assignments
identified, and field placements arranged. The discussion then focuses on
making this all happen for one particular student.
For example, because Lorraine has difficulty reading and writing, it is
necessary for someone to give her a copy of their class notes so they can
be read onto a tape for her to review at home. A group assignment is
adapted so Lorraine&#8217;s group will be evaluated not only on their
presentation but on how they involve her in completing the work. Instead
of a book review, Lorraine will do a film review, spoken into a tape
recorder rather than written out. A field placement will be scaled to her
confidence level; but it will take place on the same day, in the same
setting, and under the same supervision as for everyone else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Peer Education</em></strong><br>
Despite thorough planning, challenges arise along the way. For example,
when the semester first began, a dilemma arose over how to elicit the
support of students in Lorraine&#8217;s class. Should Lorraine simply start
class on the same day as everyone else, leaving them to follow their own
instincts about how to be involved with her? She would, after all, be
with a support person whose main role would be to introduce her to other
students, initiate conversation and generally model a way of interacting.
The alternative was to inform the students that Lorraine would be joining
them before she was introduced to the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That meant going in on the first day, without
Lorraine, to introduce the subject of integration and to engage the
students immediately. The goal was to begin a forum for discussing the
issues that would inevitably arise throughout the two-year program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both methods were tried and experience showed that the former option&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;having Lorraine start with other students&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;was philosophically easier
to live with but did not allow for discussion of the program. It left the
students generally perplexed and, as a consequence, unhelpful. While the
other option meant that Lorraine was being discussed without being
present, it worked best for the students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was not altogether surprising to learn that the students, having had
very little exposure to people with mental handicaps (many recalled the
special class at the end of the hall or the few students who took gym
with them in high school), had many questions. Their comfort level was
not very high. They wanted to ask basic questions such as &#8220;How do you
say Hi?&#8221; and they wanted to ask them without inhibition and without
worrying that they might hurt Lorraine&#8217;s feelings. It is interesting, on
the other hand, that the students themselves questioned the ethics of
starting class without Lorraine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Out of that first discussion on relations with Lorraine, a core of
students came forward who were willing to meet once a month with Lorraine
and someone from CICE to talk through problems, listen to her concerns
and get to know one another better. Those group meeting provided an
important outlet, especially for identifying potential difficulties
before they became problems. Gradually, those students began to take on
the responsibility of ensuring that Lorraine was getting the notes she
needed and keeping her hinders organized, and they made sure that she
ordered the class sweatshirt before the deadline. Sensitive to her
longing to feel connected, they began to extend invitations to lunch and
to an aerobics class which coincided with their spare period. And they
began to delight in her growing selfassuredness and accomplishments.
Nor was Lorraine the only one benefitting from these group meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They were becoming
a fun and important part of other students&#8217; lives as conversations
ranged from school-work to families and vacations to jobs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Faculty&#8217;s Creative Solutions</em></strong><br>
If the students were an important group to bring on side, so too were the
faculty members, and they posed an entirely different set of challenges.
Many were willing to have a student in their class; for example, the Chair
of the Hospitality Program felt it would be valuable for his students&#8217;
interpersonal skills, improving their ability to work with people with
different backgrounds. Consequently, he advised all students that they
would be evaluated, in part, on their capacity to support each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other faculty members, however, claimed that, with no background in
special education, they lacked the necassary expertise. Some were pleased
to have a support person in class so that they could carry on with
business as usual without fear of disruption; others were uncomfortable
with what they saw, at first, as an intrusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers at the college and university level who become involved with
integration for the first time often look for direction from their
institution in adapting and modifying curriculum. However, as is always
the case, they are creative and inventive when left to their own devices.
As in public and high schools, solutions to curriculum at the
post-secondary level are found more through a shift in attitude&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;how
one sees a person&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;than through technical approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A certain teacher of advanced communications welcomed into his class a
new student who had pleaded her own case before the Dean that very
morning. She requested she be allowed in his class because &#8220;that&#8217;s where
all my friends are&#8221;.
In truth, given her eyesight and her difficulty reading, entry tests to
the most basic communication courses would have served little practical
purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher agreed to work with her and, as the term progressed, they
developed the habit of spending a few
minutes chatting after each class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One afternoon, the student told him about the self-advocacy group,
People First, which was protesting the following weekend against a
controversial wage policy. Proposed by the previous provincial government,
the policy would allow employers to pay people who had been labelled less
than minimum wage. His student was certainly going to attend the rally,
being an active member of the organization. The teacher was interested
and engaged; when it came to the lesson on writing business letters, he
suggested she write hers, with his help, to the provincial government
about that very issue. She embraced the assignment whole-heartedly. Her
finished product met the requisite specifications: she stated her case,
and, having had access to the computer lab, presented a polished letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a second student in an Effective Speaking course decided at the last
minute to sing Christmas carols instead of playing the taped address
which he and his peer tutor had so diligently prepared for his
presentation, only his tutor squirmed.
All the other students applauded his efforts, and his instructor awarded
him a resounding grade of seventy-one percent with a written
congratulation for knowing better than anyone else in the class &#8220;how to
really get into the act of presenting&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Support Staff</em></strong><br>
The support staff at Humber proved to be unsung heros, providing help on
a regular basis. This was the case when one student, intending to take
twenty dollars out of a bank machine, accidentally got the decimal point
in the wrong place and ended up with significantly more money. She
immediately received a lesson on making a deposit. The people at the
library desk became well-acquainted with one student who, while searching
for her library card in her wallet, would always fumble, dropping all the
photographs of her family, her cat, and even one of herself &#8220;when she
had short hair&#8221;. Reassembling her paraphernalia always took a few
minutes, enough time to chat and to offer to show the photos around,
again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cafeteria cashiers learned to slow the pace down to allow people time to
count out their money. One cashier even ran a tab to accommodate a
favourite student who loved the fish and chips platter but did not always
have enough money to pay for it. How that till was balanced every night
is still a mystery!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Parent Advocacy</em></strong><br>
Parents have been involved since the founding of the Humber program and
they now play a pivotal role on the Advisory Committee. Some people
question the appropriateness of involving parents, knowing how most
college students are fairly independent of their families. Despite these
doubts, parent support is essential, and communication between parents
and faculty has become an accepted part of the daily routine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many parents, well on their way to burn-out after twenty or more years of
advocacy and struggle, now watch their sons and daughters thrive in
college. It brings them new energy and fresh resolve for facing the
impending question of work.
Somehow the posibilities for their children seem greater than before.
They see improved self-confidence and motivation in their children.
Several said this was the first time their son or daughter saw him or
herself as someone who could make a contribution and have a place in
society. One father, commenting on his son&#8217;s daily telephone conversation
with a longstanding friend, said he could not get over the growth of his
son&#8217;s vocabulary and how much more worldly he was in his conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Student Involvement</em></strong><br>
Students supported by CICE certainly benefitted, and so did their peers,
as is obvious in the testimonial of a human services student:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I first learned I was going to do a placement with CICE I was not
exactly excited. I&#8217;m not patient enough,
I worried. What was I going to learn working with people with a disability,
I wondered. I realize now how despite my image of myself as an open-minded
person and someone with curiosity, I knew nothing about segregation. In
fact I would never have even recognized it had I not been exposed to
integration. Without realizing it, I had been taught, subconsciously, just
to accept things the way they are. That in itself was a profound learning
experience.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ask students why they chose to go to college and they will invariably
mention the possibility of making new friends. Some students might set a
higher priority on getting a well-paying and secure job, others on
getting a good education, but the social aspects are a very attractive
feature of student life.
Many life-long friendships trace their beginnings to meetings at concerts,
lecture halls and cafeterias on campus. Other relationships fade when the
college years are over but are long remembered as part of an important
stage of personal growth and discovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As students pursue their own interests, there are endless possibilities
for meeting other students with similar interests: dancing at the monthly
pubs; attending poetry readings in the library; setting up the sound
system for a concert or jam session; at a quiet magazine rack in the
library or a music listening corner. Whole sections of the cafeteria are
devoted to card games and homework; these are places where camaraderie
and collaboration on assignments are encouraged. Organized opportunities
to socialize also abound: at student council fund-raising barbecues,
aerobathons, and morale-boating mid-winter madness escapads. The
opportunities for personal development are an important part of the
culture of colleges and universities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One particular young man comes to mind. His parents withdrew him from the
sheltered workshop he had been attending for a number of years and
applied to Humber on his
behalf.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Justifiably suspicious that he was in for something completely different,
he arrived the first day with his Walkman. He kept the earphones pluged
in for several weeks while he assessed his new situation. It must have
been bewildering returning to school after having been in the
&#8220;workplace&#8221;, and suddenly having to learn what was considered
acceptable behaviour in a college setting, and having to assimilate the
dress code and the constant socializing.
Gradually he became more comfortable as the students got to know him.
Some said &#8220;Hi&#8221;, others helped him write letters to his favourite uncle,
still others talked hockey scores with him.
A few insisted he improve his math skills by joining them at cards. Not
immune to the flirting and sexuality so much apart of the atmosphere, his
first year was replete with crushes and frustration at unrequited love.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a time he chose to work in the parking lot with the attendant.
Between accepting parking fees and waving through people with permits he
and the attendant chatted about the weather, the latest politician
involved in a scandal, sporting highlights and weekends. When both men
left the college they saw no good reason for these conversations to end
and they have been friends since.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>The Transition to the Workplace</em></strong><br>
The training, skills and personal contacts that come with a quality
integrated educational experience lead to greater employment opportunities.
Post-secondary settings are natural places for students to make the
transition from school to the workplace. Students everywhere leave high
school and decide to further their education, thereby gaining some time
to mature, broaden their base of experience, and make decisions about
their interests before considering the issue of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Evaluating Success</em></strong><br>
As the Humber program moves towards stability and permanence,
administrators and faculty members have expressed
interest in what the students are actually learning in class; they claim
to see the social value of integration, but they can&#8217;t always he certain
about the educational value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Standards for student evaluation and success will need to be developed
but the challenge is to make them particular to each student and each
individual program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That raises another looming issue: grades. All students want to be graded
on their work. But when support is given to some students on all their
assignments and tests, and the tash themselves are tangibly altered,
questions about the validity and comparability of grades inevitably arise.
The instructor who gives a student sixty-five per cent on a photography
assignment but who admits that he helped the student load the film and
adjust the camera, gets full marks in my books for appropriate support;
other people allege bias.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps evaluations could he comprised of written comments only,
applauding accomplishment and pointing out areas yet to he mastered. Or
they could be a numerical grade measuring the distance between where the
student started from and where they have reached.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another challenge is graduation. Eventually, the college may choose to
hold a ceremony in which students graduate with their peers and receive
a modified diploma indicating their participation and achievements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is always a sense of urgency in overcoming these obstacles for
people with disabilities because so much time has already been wasted.
Dr. Robert Gordon, president of Humber, reflected after six years of
integration:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is good for the college because in a funny sort of way we are a
disparate group of departments and specializations. This program, in its
own way, has forced an interaction and integration of our own people in
a way that was never happening before. There is a mutual topic of
discussion and a very rewarding one at that. So I think that in its
unique fashion, in its own
way, it has contributed a great deal to the college.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Gordon<br>
<cite>1990</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s students become tomorrow&#8217;s neighbours, co-workers, journalists,
law-makers, public servants, teachers and employers. The values
inculcated in them by a truly inclusive educational environment will
shape future communities. These people will advance the efforts of the
community living movement in seeking opportunities for people with mental
handicaps. When institutes of higher education make a welldefined
commitment to becoming more inclusive, at a time when issues of equality
and rights are high on Canadians&#8217; agendas, they will ensure that their
own fixture is both relevant and socially responsible.</p>

<p>This annotated bibliography was compiled by Mary Ellen Mulligan for The
Roeher Institute. It contains a selection of additional resources
regarding the inclusion of students with disabilities in regular classes
in regular schools. The first section of the bibliography contains
material on the philosophical underpinnings of integration, the legal and
historical framework, and the human rights and advocacy issues. The second
part of the bibliography deals primarily with the &#8220;howto&#8217;s&#8221; of
integration including administrative issues, teacher preparation and
practical strategies and models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In compiling this bibliopaphy an effort was made to include the most
recent publications available on the subject:
most of the books and journal articles were published within the past
five years. Special consideration was given to highlight the situation in
Canada in regard to innovative policy and practice. Much of the material
listed in the bibliogaphy was drawn from the library of The Roeher
Institute. Many of the journals and monographs are also available from
educational institutions across the country.</p>

The author suggests that the goals of integration are to redefine
&#8220;normality&#8221; to include diversity and to support people to identify their
own aspirations and opportunities. He looks critically at the different
ways in which the concept of integration has been interpreted in
literature. The concept of integration should prompt teachers and others
to challenge the social relations and curricula of schools and link these
to the ways in which inequalities are maintained.</p>

In 1971, integrated schooling was mandated by Italian law for all students

with issues of labelling, time
individualization and appropriate supports, after almost twenty years of
experience with an integrated system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author notes that the importance of Italy&#8217;s experience is that &#8220;they
have done it &#8230;&#8203; They have made and continue to make systemic changes
that encourage the valuing of all young people &#8230;&#8203; that make it possible
to simply stop separating people and then work on the problems as they
arise.&#8221; In this way, integration is presented, not as a singular event,
but as an effort that &#8220;will never be finished.&#8221;</p>

This chapter presents a rationale for the integration of students with
handicaps into the regular school, listing benefits for the integated
child, the family, students without disabilities, and professional staff.
The authors maintain that, in the United States, integration practice
lags behind federal law and that a major barrier is &#8220;philosophical

<p>They conclude that, &#8220;While students with the most profound disabilities

This article challenges the usefulness of the integration vs. segregation
debate. Ideological arguments which themselves constitute barriers to
integration include manipulation of the phrase &#8220;best interests of the
child&#8221;, an attitude of defeatism, the &#8220;limited time and energy&#8221;

The author defines &#8220;special-ordinary education&#8221; as &#8220;individualized

making modifications and allowances for years in order to accommodate

The author challenges ten often-heard objections to mainstreaming.
Attitudes detrimental to mainstreaming include a tendency to think in
terms of a unified prescribed curriculum and a focus on the disability
rather than on the person and the person&#8217;s abilities, &#8220;hence building a
case against the child, rather than for the child&#8217;s inclusion in the
regular classroom.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He further states that there is a need for regular classroom teachers to
accept responsibility for all students and to accept a wider range of
individual differences. The corollary to this is the provision of
appropriate support, information and resources to teachers. He concludes
that, &#8220;It is not that mainstreaming has been tried and found wanting; it
has been found difficult and not tried.&#8221;</p>

This article is written by a teacher who, with no special training,
integrated Susan, a student with handicaps, into her Grade 5 classroom.
She documents her initial fears and worries about her ability to meet
Susan&#8217;s various needs, and about the increased work load and the possible
impact on the academic progress of other students. Yet what originally
seemed a daunting task evolves into a mutual learning process for all.
The author learns to involve Susan in the general program, make small
adaptations to the curriculum, and allow and encourage natural interactions
with peers.</p>

An Adaptive Learning Environments Model (ALEM) was implemented in five
schools of a large urban school system as a full-time mainstreaming
program. It was designed for students with mild handicaps who had
previously been served in self-contained special education programs.
While many general education teachers had expected problems in dealing
with students with mental handicaps, difficulties were rare. Staff
development was identified by participating teachers as a key factor in
the program&#8217;s success.</p>
