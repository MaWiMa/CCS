<p>All participants are responsible for defining and analyzing problems, for
establishing and maintaining the collaborative partnership, and for
follow-up. Since the referring teacher is responsible for the student
and for implementing the interventions, he or she is the best judge of
what strategies are suitable and makes the final decision.</p>

<p><strong><em>Preventative Function</em></strong><br>
Problem solving has a dual focus. It provides a mechanism to deal with
immediate problems, and it has the potential to help teachers control
the factors that cause and maintain the problem. It can both ease existing
problems and prevent existing difficulties from being more severe.</p>

<p>The first objective is met by developing specific interventions to deal
with the current problem. The second is accomplished in a less direct
manner. Teachers can share their experience and expertise with each other
when they interact frequently. Problem-solving sessions meats the
opportunities for interaction. Teachers can share knowledge and improve
their skills so similar problems can be dealt with more effectively in
the future. In most cases, it is necessary for teachers to address several
problem situations successfully before they can handle problems independently.
Training teachers to deal with a single problem situation has been
ineffective in teaching them general skills for coping with a variety of
circumstances (Pryzwansky, 1989).</p>

<p><strong><em>Participants</em></strong><br>
The team should have five to seven members. At minimum, a facilitator and
three other teachers are needed to make the problem-solving process work
effectively. As noted earlier, the facilitator is often a methods and
resource teacher or guidance counsellor, but can also be an administrator
or teacher. On occasion the student who is the central figure in the
situation may be requested to participate since he or she has the most
at stake in the process (Thousands and Villa, in press, b).</p>
