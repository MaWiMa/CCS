students.)
* Does he change his behaviour after you speak to him? (For a few minutes.)
* How does her react to one-on-one talks with you? (He gets very angry.)
* Is work experience part of his program? (Not yet, but he will be going

*Stage 4:* The brainstorming session provided the following suggestions:

. Choose the smallest behaviour that you want to stop and develop a plan
to stop that behaviour with built-in rewards.
. Video-tape Nathan in the classroom over a period of time to show him
what he is doing or have some observation done to establish a baseline of
his behaviour.
. Provide modification to plan for success and reduce frustration.
. Tape materials that he has to read and provide discussion time, so that
he will understand what he reads.
. Provide time for small cooperative group work.
. Hold cooperative group activities that stress social skills.
. Work with school social worker to set up behaviour modification plan.
. Look at relationships with friends.
. Bring parents in and make frequent home contact.
