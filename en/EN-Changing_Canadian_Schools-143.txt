==== Sources of Personal Satisfaction

There was a time when I distrusted regular education. I would never have
allowed a child who had special needs to go into a regular shool system
bcause I thought it would ki11 them. But after seeing that it could work
and being part of it and seeing the change in the children, naturally I
had to change my attitude. I always believed in individualized education,
but I was't sure that it was possible in the school system. But now I can
see -- I mean it stares me in the face everyday -- that schools can change,
that teacher practice can change.

This attitude is not unique. Many educators, are sceptical of the capacity
of regular school programs to accept and provide for special needs students.

However, a new and optimistic view is not unique either. Most of the methods
and recource teachers feel very positive. They feel that integration is
working and that their role in support of regular class teachers is an
important element in making it work.

The rewards they receive are quite different than those experienced in the
regular classroom. M&R teachers get satisfaction from facilitating the suceess
of others. They have to enjoy being advocates for students and their families.
They have to be challenged by the help they provide to teachers to find
alternate strategies for students:

I've had a lot of satisfaction from seeing the improvements in students,
when in September, I thought, "`What are we going todo with this child?`"
[I've had satisfaction from] seeing integration work, and the support of
staff and administration and students. We've had so many students who have
taken it upon themselves to make it work.

[I enjoy] seeing the results! When you actually see a student progressing
you feel good about it because chances are that progress would not have
taken place unless there had been intervention of some kind and that's when
you feel good.
