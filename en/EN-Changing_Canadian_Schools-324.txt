Four hundred and forty-six books, reports and journal articles are
reviewed and arranged by topic. The ratio of empirical research studies
supporting integation to research opposing it is more than eighteen to
one. But the ratio of position papers supporting integration to research
opposing it is only 1.6 to one. The authors interpret this to mean that
integrating practices are proving successful but that attitudes generally
lag behind research in this area.

Twenty-seven Canadian articles are reviewed; thirty-two articles are
listed under the topic of elementary school integration. Of these, one is
cross-listed.

This comprehensive review was motivated by "`concern for the extent to
which mainstreaming is being done in Ontario, the way in which it is
being done, and the acceptance of the underlying philosophical
assumptions.`" Resources are well organized into sections including
reasons for mainstreaming, models of mainstreaming, legislative bases
and teacher inservice training. The author presents seventy-three
research conclusions and notes, "`If there is one overwhelming conclusion
it must be that mainstreaming is being poorly done in many cases.`"

This review reveals the emphasis in literature on categorizing handicaps
and maintaining different environments for different degrees of
integration. It is a useful compilation of resources with high Canadian
content, giving an overview of attitudes and degrees of implmentation of
mainstreaming at the time it was compiled.
