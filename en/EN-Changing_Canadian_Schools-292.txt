Today's students become tomorrow's neighbours, co-workers, journalists,
law-makers, public servants, teachers and employers. The values
inculcated in them by a truly inclusive educational environment will

and rights are high on Canadians`' agendas, they will ensure that their
own fixture is both relevant and socially responsible.
