<p>Most schools have two teachers working in the M&amp;R role. They rely heavily
on each other, sharing the trials and frustrations of the position. At several
schools where the M&amp;R teachers were interviewed, they divided the class
equally at each grade level. For example, in one school serving Grades 1 to 5,
each M&amp;R teacher took responsibility for two of the four classes at each
level. They said this keeps each teacher involved with the whole curriculum
of the school. It also permits them to work as a team on curriculum questions,
and substitute for each other if necessary. The teamwork includes frequent
discussion of perspectives on individual cases and appropriate instructional
strategies:</p>

<p>We share the work. That way we can talk back and forth and compare what
we&#8217;ve done with different students. Maybe something I&#8217;ve done would be useful
to her and vice versa. Teachers know which M&amp;R teacher they should go to,
but sometimes in an emergency they talk to whoever they meet. We take care
of it. We often discuss assessments. It&#8217;s nice to have that back up, someone
who can confirm what you see. It&#8217;s also great because we&#8217;re both familiar
with all the kids and there are times when we have to sit in on a meeting
for the other M&amp;R teacher.</p>

<p>In some schools M&amp;R teachers work out of the same room and discuss things
on an informal basis. In other schools, they have formal meetings once a
week where they discuss problems or issues. This seems more prevalent at
the high school than at the elementary level. One of the high schools reported
formal meetings each week that are attended by the three teacher&#8217;s aides
as well as the two M&amp;R teachers. They feel this helps them discuss and resolv
student and scheduling problems and deal with organizational issues.</p>
