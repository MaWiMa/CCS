<p><strong>Endicott, Orville. (1987). The Elwood Settlement Agreement: What does it
mean? <em>entourage</em>, 2(3), pp. 36-37, 42.</strong><br>
This article recounts the legal struggle of one family to obtain integrated
education for their son, Luke. It attributes the capitulation of the
school board, before court action, to a foundation of claims under the
<em>Charter of Rights</em>, expert testimony regarding integrated programming,
the principles of Luke&#8217;s parents, and Luke himself, who &#8220;blossomed and
grew&#8221; during his one year of integrated schooling.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it did not lead to a binding judicial agreement, this case will
provide valuable evidence in subsequent cases regarding education
integration as a right.</p>

<p><strong>Greey, Madeleine. (1991). We all belong: Welcoming children with special
needs. <em>Today&#8217;s Parent</em>, April, pp.34-40.</strong><br>
Casting the issue as a civil rights battle and a fight for the right to
belong, this article presents the struggles of a number of parents
fighting for community integration for their children. Successful
integration experiences at camp, at school and with other families are
contested with experiences of exclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author notes that, while some school boards in Ontario follow a policy
of full integration, only in New Brunswick is integration mandated by law
and practised province-wide.</p>

<p>Some Canadian resources for parents (organizations, videos, and books)
are listed at the end of the article.</p>

national dilemma. <em>Homemakers&#8217; Magazine</em>, May, pp. 11-20.</strong>
This is the story of an Ontario family&#8217;s legal battle to obtain integrated
school placement for their adopted daughter. The article presents the
views of those advocating Becky&#8217;s inclusion in her neighbourhood school
and the opposing views of school board officials and others who believed
that her needs
would best be met in a segregated school with special staff and resources.</p>
