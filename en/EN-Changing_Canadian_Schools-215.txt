At this point the sentences were put in a paragraph identical to the
original paragraph and the student was asked to fill in the blanks.

*Lesson:* Language Arts +
*Topic:* Listening Skills +
*Grade:* 3

Alter several listening activities, the teacher realized that a student
with special needs was having serious difficulty with the exercise. He
constantly interrupted by moving about the class distracting others. The
teacher photocopied pictures from the book she was reading and had the
student with special needs place the pictures on the board at the appropriate
time using magnetic strips. At first, she tapped a bell to indicate when
he was to place the pictures on the chalkboard. The technique allowed for
inclusion of the student as well as keeping him on task. The student had
become a valued member of the class and was actually helping other students
to improve their listening skills. (Sherille Crouse, 1989)


*Lesson:* Social Studies +
*Topic:* Introduction of the provence of Québec +
*Grade:* 5

The boundaries and important places in Québec were discussed. The students
were expected to label these places on a map using an overhead produced
by the teacher. The student with special needs was assisted by assigned
students. Lines were drawn on the map within which the names of places
were printed. The spelling was checked by the students, who were also
expected to make notes about the places or events discussed. The important
facts were written on the board to provide a guide for the students to
use for writing complete sentences. The student with special needs listed
the facts but was not responsible for writing the sentences. As a result,
the student felt a part of the lesson. He benefitted from the lesson by
learning the main ideas and the class benefitted by learning a study
skill -- utilizing key facts to remember notes.
