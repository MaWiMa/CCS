. Have the student repeat other students`' responses.

. Have the student give an example from his or her own experience that
relates to the lesson.

. Give the student "`think time`". Call on the student and say it will be
his or her turn soon.

. Use short, sequential instructions with back-up written instructions.

. At the beginning of the lesson use concrete language. Abstract, higher
level language can be used later.
. Check for understanding by having students retell instructions or
paraphrase information in their own words.

. Check for oral reading ability in order to avoid embarrassing situations.
Allow students with severe reading problems to do oral reading practice
outside the classroom.

. Include the student in small group discussions. Some verbal prompting
may be needed by designated members of the group.

. Use peers to drill key words and ideas in order to make the student
accountable.

*_SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH OUT VERBAL SKILLS:_*

. Assign students on a rotating basis to help others with seatwork.

. Students who have difficulty writing notes from the board can be
required to copy only main parts of the notes. The main ideas could be
underlined so the student knows what to copy. The student could also be
given a photocopy of another student's notes.

. Non-readers could be provided with taped notes done by the teacher or
another student. The notes would only include the essential points.

. In oral spelling tests perhaps the student would only be responsible
for beginning or ending sounds.
