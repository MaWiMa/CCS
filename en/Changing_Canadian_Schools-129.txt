M&.R teachers must include teacher's aides in planning
strategies for students. Since teacher's m'des one in the class-
room with the student, they oﬂen have insights and informa-
tion that can contribute to the problem-solving task. At the
high school level, teacher's aides are used to support students
as they go to regular clasm throughout the school. They also
play a major role in community access and employment
prop-ams for students with severe disabilities. Teacher's aides
are most often the staﬂ' member to mmpany a student on
work placements. In situations where there is only one M&R
teacher in the school, the teacher's aide is a source of moral
support for the teacher: “It helps a lot, having a teacher’ s aide,
because then you're not there all by yourself. At least you have
somebody else there who knows how hard you’re world lg.”
Teamwork with Parents
M&R teachers view parents in much the same way they ®
regular class teachers. They recognize that parents are mitical
to students’ success in school, so they must cooperate with and
involve parents. However, like teachers, mots bring unique
personalities and levels of expectation to the relationship.
