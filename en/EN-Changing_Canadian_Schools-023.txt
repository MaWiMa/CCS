The case has received considerable national attention from both parents and school
officials (Mac.Kay, 1987b; McCallum, 1987).

In addition to the impetus of the _Charter of Rights and Freedoms_ (1982),
a number of parents, parent groups, and educators throughout Canada have
been calling for more integrated and inclusive school programs for students
with disabilities.
In the province of New Brunswick, this led to political action, and,
as indicated above, subsequent legislafive reform. Bill 85, which addresses
the equality and procedural issues for educational practise that flow from the Charter,
was unanimously passed by the New Brunswick legislature in 1986.  
Section 45(2)1 of Bill 85 (1986) deals with placement considerations and
is particularly significant:  

[quote]
____
A school board shall place exceptional pupils such that
they receive special education programs and services
in circumstances where exceptional pupils can participate
with pupils who are not exceptional pupils within regularclassroom settings
to the extent that is considered practicable by the board having due regard for
the education needs of all pupils.
____

This section provides clear direction that integrated school programs are assumed
to be appropriate for exceptional students in New Brunswick schools.
Alternatives are to be used only after every attempt has been made to make an integrated
program work. A school board may decide that an integrated program is not practicable
for a given student, for a given period of fime, for specific reasons; however, withdrawal
is to occur only for compelling reasons that are considered necessary to meet the child's
needs and on the condition that a plan to return the child to the regular class is made
at the time of the withdrawal (Department of Education, Province of New Brunswick, 1988a).
