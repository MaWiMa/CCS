<p><strong>Stage 7:</strong> The facilitator thanked the participants and assured
each one that their help was greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The follow-up meeting was held to assess progress to date. The
referring teacher was extremely pleased with the results of the
suggestions which he had tried after the problem-solving meeting.
He and the methods and resource teacher had met with Amanda&#8217;s
mother and found her to be cooperative. The suggestions for
improving her reading and writing skills had been equally successful.
He had seen a remarkable improvement in Amanda&#8217;s writing and said
that she was reading with much more confidence now. His over-all
assessment was positive; he found the problem-solving process to be
a valuable strategy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case Study Two: Nathan</em></strong>
Basically there is a behaviour problem. Nathan. a Grade 11 student,
disrupts the class, causes serious difficulties for other learners,
and refuses to take responsibility for his own behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The facilitator explained that the purpose of the meeting
was to help the referring teacher develop some strategies to deal
with Nathan, a student in her Grade 11 English class. The facilitator
specified that the referring teacher was looking for ideas to confront
Nathan with the reality of the sffects of his behaviour and also some
strategies to help change his behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> The referring teacher elaborated on the problem by stating
that Nathan&#8217;s disruptive behaviours included pushing desks, striking out
to other students, staying turned around in his seat, and continually
talking. When she talked to him privately about this, Nathan refused to
accept that there was a problem; instead, he blamed the other students.</p>
