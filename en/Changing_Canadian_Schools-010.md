# Preface
As someone interested in issues of social reform and strategies
for change, I feel it is a special privilege to write this preface
for *Changing Canadian Schools.*
This is a very well balanced, thorough, and practical book.
Its chapters contain clear analysis of all the roles involved in
changing special education practices. It provides perspectives
and insights from the points of view of parents, administrators,
regular classroom teachers, special education resource teachers,
consultants and school board staff, and more.
Personal stories and case studies make the reading interesting,
poignant and rich. Larger scale analysis and synthesis are
also provided on the law, policy making and policy content.

The book contains many ideas for strategies and practical
suggestions for success. It combines advocacy with insight,
and demonstrates that both will (persistens) and skill (good
strategies) are needed for success. There is no other book of
its kind in Canada that provides such a timely and comprehensive
account of the state-of-the-art of special education reform.

Special education reform represents just about all the issues
involved in bringing about educational reform. The existence
of significant social needs even when combined with
legislation is not sufficient to achieve reform. ~~We know from a~~ -> page 11
