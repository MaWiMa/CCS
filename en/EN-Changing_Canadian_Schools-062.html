<p>If, on the other hand, there was a will to create a school system in which
children truly had equal opportunities, the new system would have to look
very different from the one now in place.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What then is the real message of an education system which is designed to
value things that persons with mental handicaps cannot do, and which then
claim them uneducable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inherent in its attitude is a presumption about theincamcities of persons
with mental handicaps. In addition, there is an implied expectation that
persons with a mental handicap will not be in regular public schools or
participants in the community in general. It is not surprising that the
person with a mental handicap has problems functioning in an environment
based on these assumptions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an environment created with no consideration
of their abilities or participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the heyday of social darwinism and the eugenics movement, education
became the basis of qualification for entrance into elites, and the school
system became the certifying agency. Science thought it had found a way
to quantify and measure people&#8217;s intelligence. Science seemed to provide
objective criteria which justified selective participation, entitlement
and rights&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which, in fact, legitimized a system of dismimination. A
rationale was created for particular distinctions and labels, which
could have a medical and professional basis rather than a social basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now know that science is unable to completely quantify intelligence.
However, standardized testing and narrow curriculum persist in disentitling
some people and restricting their opportunities to participate. Gould, in
his classic work <strong>The Mismeasure of Man</strong> (1981), claims that we continue
to assign to intelligence a whole set of complex human capabilities that
support "` &#8230;&#8203; the [recognition of] the importance of mentality in our lives
and wish to characterize it, in part so that we can make the divisions
and distinctions among people that our cultural and political systems dictate.`"</p>
