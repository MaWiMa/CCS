<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that teachers are reported to be more apprehensive about
students with severe disabilities than those with mild or moderate disabilities.
The development of positive attitudes toward all students, irrespective of
disability, should be a universal goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers are convinced that teachers need direct experience
with integation in order for attitudes to change. They need to get to know
the student and directly experience the benefits the student gets from integrated
education:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One teacher who has a special needs student was really nervous and very
uptight. Since it was his first year [with a student with challenging needs
in his class] he depended on me almost one hundred per cent during the months
of September and into October. But now he&#8217;is enjoying this student. He comes
to me probably two or three times a week to ask a question, but he&#8217;s taken
the student as one of his own and has done a lot more than I had even hoped.
Experience does make a difference. They have to have a year under their belts
before some of the fear is alleviated.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The acceptance of integration grows with experience, but it doesn&#8217;t eliminate
teachers&#8217; concerns about a number of very practical matters. One M&amp;R teacher
pointed out that teachers become more anxious and concerned about integration
as classes increase in size. Teachers are also concerned about having students
with severe behaviour problems in their classes. This includes students who
are physically aggressive towards other students or the teacher and those
who are selfabusive.</p>
