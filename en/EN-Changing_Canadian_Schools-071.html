<p>In other words, education statutes refer to a general right for children
to receive an education, but the power is vested in the school board to
decide where to place children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one notable exception to this general rule. Arguably the most
progressive education legslative provisions to advance the interests of
children with a disability are found in the <em>Schools Act</em> in New Brunswick.
After defining exmptionalities in terms of behavioural, communication,
intellectual, physical, perceptual, or multiple, the <em>Act</em> directs that
a school board:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>shall place exceptional pupils such that they receive special education
programs in circumstances where exceptional pupils can participate with
pupils who are not exceptional pupils within regular classroom settings
to the extent that is considered practicable by the school board having
due regard for the educational needs of all Pupils.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite these amendments, children continued to be segregated in New
Brunswick, particularly in francophone school districts. The Robichaud
family of New Brunswick objected to the segregation of their teenage
daughter in a special class to children with disabilities. The parents
removed Nathalie from the segregated setting and were keeping her at home.
They began proceedings by applying for a mandatory injunction which would
require the school board to place Nathalie in a regular high school classroom.
The court which heard their application interpreted the education
legislation as specifically providing each child, regardless of disability,
with the right to be educated in a regular classroom alongside his or her
non-disabled peers. The court accepted the argument of the parents that
the <em>Schools Act</em> was consistent with the equality requirement in the
<em>Charter</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The family argued and the court held that the Act was constitutional and
enforceable in Nathalie&#8217;s favour because it required a school board to
provide the equal educational benefit to all children including those who
have a disability.</p>
