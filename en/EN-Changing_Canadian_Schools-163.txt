Similarly, the current teachers need time to prepare the receiving teachers.
This may include observing the receiving teacher in the classroom environment,
meeting with him or her and following up on omervations and meetings once the
student has been in the receiving teacher's class.

This planning often becomes more crucial when a student is entering a new
school such as junior or senior high. The principals between the schools
need to facilitate scheduling times for these observations and meetings.

*_Enhance Teacher Expectations and Attitudes_* +
In some cases, teachers said they needed to raise their expectations and
enhance their attitudes toward their exceptional students. This appeared
to be particularly true for teachers of high school students. In other cases,
classroom teachers had expectations that were too high, and consequently
became frustrated because their exceptional students were unable to perform
like the other students.

When exceptional students do not perform at an expected level, the teachers
often feel they are not doing enough for them. To help alleviate confusion
and develop realistic expectations, teachers need to be involved right from
the beginning. Administrators should ensure that all classroom teachers are
involved in the initial planning sessions for integrating exceptional students.
Even though at the high school level this would involve many teachers, it
would help all teachers to know in advance what is expected of them and
their students. The initial meeting helps prevent teachers and students from
becoming overwhelmed and frustrated by vague and unclear expectations and
goals. Once the student is in the regular classroom, it may be helpful for
the principal, the classroom teacher, and the methods and resource teacher
to collaborate in answering the following questions:

. Why is the student in the regular class?
. What will be expected of the student?
. What will be expected of each teacher?
