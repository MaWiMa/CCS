They express concern about the effect students with distracfing or disrupting
behaviours have on other students and their ability to pay attention and
benefit from instruction. Again, however, direct experience seems to be
the key to a fear of the unknown. Ones the teacher gets to know the student
and begins to experience the success of integration, attitudes begin to change.

One of the M&R teachers noted an interesting ambiguity between the way some
teachers talk about integration and the way they act. She suggests that
while some teachers still say they are opposed to it, their actions aren't
consistent with their words:

Even though you hear them saying things against [integration], their actions
don't support what they're saying. I think people are still afraid of saying
in front of their peers, "`Well, maybe it's not such a bad thing.`" They've
been saying that it's so terrible for yeors and they can't lose face and
say that may be their attitude has changed. There seems to be a thing about
it that once you select a side you have to stay with that side.

The attitudes of teachers in districts 28 and 29 have been changing for
the positive. One M&R teacher surveyed the opinions of teachers in her
school about integration. She reported that twenty-four of the thirty teachers
responded and only two of the twenty-four teachers indicated they did not
think that students should he integrated. Although a few continued to have
negative attitudes about the integration process, twelve of the twenty-four
said that their attitudes had changed and nine of the twelve reported that
their attitudes were more positive.
