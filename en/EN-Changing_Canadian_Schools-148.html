detail the use of time in each area. Most of the time M&amp;R teachers are actively

<p>It is interesting to note that only about 13 per cent of the M&amp;R teachers&#8217;
time was devoted to pull-out instruction. Special education teachers have

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was an emphasis on special education teachers replacing regular classroom
teachers as the instructors of special nude children. In their new capacity
as M&amp;R teachers, they spend a majority of their time consulting with and
helping teachers rather than replacing them.</p>
