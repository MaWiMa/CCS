<p>The following activities, assigned to a class to show their understanding
of plot of a story, illustrate the use of different modes of presentation
and the different levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy:</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>Discuss the plot of television shows to allow for verbal rather than
written presentation.</em><br>
This task involves knowledge and comprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>In small groups, write or discuss what each student did that day.</em><br>
This involves practice in sequencing so students can develop an
understanding of the order of events. It allows for small group activity
where students have the support of others who have more skill in the area,
and it allows them to all participate in an activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Use charades to act out events in a particular plot while the rest
of the students identify the part of the plot being shown.</em><br>
This allows students who are able to act the part to be very visible
in the lesson as well as show that they understand the events in the
story. It provides an opportunity for other students to analyze the
particular presentation and decide what is being shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Record sounds or music that could be used to illustrate certain
segments of the plot.</em><br>
This combines plot with atmosphere to challenge more advanced students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Write o plot in point form.</em><br>
This is helpful for weak writers to improve their writing skills, as well
as providing practice for other students in note-taking. The students with
more advanced skills would be expected to rewrite the points in paragraph
form.</p>
</li>
