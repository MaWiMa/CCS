This practical guide does not ask, "`Does integration work?`" or "`Who
can be integrated?`" Instead it addresses the question, "`How can we make
integration efforts successful?`" It places educational integration
within the larger context of overall community inclusion.

Sections cover strategies for administration, service delivery, and
planning and implmentation of individualized plans. Included are how-to
ideas and checklists of ways to involve students with severe handicaps
in regular programs.

The authors conclude that "`Integrated school experiences can be provided
for all severely handicapped students across a variety of school settings.`"
