<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some jurisdictions, parents can use special statutory appeal
mechanisms to question decisions to place their children in
segregated settings. These mechanisms have been established specifically
for children labelled as having &#8220;special needs&#8221;. However, this appeal
process has been rejected by many parents and advocates because they
claim it is biased. If the statutory appeal mechanism allows the decision
maker to discuss the question of whether a child should be included or
not, it is inherently discriminatory. If parents were convinced that the
appeal process would deal with education content and not with the actual
validity of integration, people might not perceive the appeal process as
biased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some jurisdictions, the appeal mechanism under education legislation
provides for a final appeal to the minister of education. A recent
decision by the minister under the <em>equivalent section</em> in Alberta came
out alter a lengthy, organized appeal by the family and supporters of the
child, Margaret Eggert. The decision came out strongly in favour of the
child entering Grade 1 in her neighbourhood school.</p>

<h4 id="_parents_carry_the_struggle">PARENTS CARRY THE STRUGGLE</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The element that permeates all of the legal challenges by parents on
behalf of their children is one of struggle. There is no universal
acceptance of children labelled disabled within the education system. At
every turn, parents must spend time, effort, money and emotion on
justifying their child&#8217;s right to be included. Resources are continually
being poured into &#8220;special&#8221; education while there is little effort to
find ways of making inclusion happen. There is little exploration of the
social and academic benefits to all children and the economic benefits to
the whole of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strategies developed by parents have been creative and intense, and
strengthened by the involvement of family members, friends and advocates.</p>
