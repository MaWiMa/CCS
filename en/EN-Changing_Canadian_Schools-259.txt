Facilitating peer relationships requires building and maintaining supportive
and caring relationships in which the person is valued as a separate and
unique individual, regardless of the perceived special need. Having friends
who value appropriate behaviour and behave as competent role models is

being isolated from peers is one of the major symptoms of psychological
distress. Psychological distress can be the result of isolation (i.e.,
streaming students) or it can cause the isolation (i.e., students who
become lonely because of a lack of social skills). Influencing the peer
group may be one of the most important actions adults can take to ensure
that children who are distressed have an opportunity to become successful
and competent members of their peer groups.
