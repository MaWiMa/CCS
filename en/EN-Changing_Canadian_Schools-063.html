<p>The original IQ tests, developed by Binet in 1904, had the express and
limited purpose &#8220;&#8230;&#8203; of identifying children whose poor performance
indicated a need for special education &#8230;&#8203; And the aim of his scale was
to identify in order to help and improve, not to label in order to limit&#8221;
(Gould, 1981).
Binet presumed that intelligence could be augmented by education designed to cater
to the specific needs of the child. His three principles for using his tests were:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The scores are a practical devise; they do not buttress any theory of
intellect. They do not define anything innate or permanent. We may not
designate what they measure as &#8220;intelligence&#8221; or any other reified entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scale is a rough, empirical guide for identifying mildly retarded
and learning-disabled children who need special help. It is not a device
for ranking normal children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever the cause of dificulty in children identified for help, emphasis
shall be placed upon improvment through special training. Low scores shall
not be used to mark children as innately incapable. (Gould, 1981)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These principles were disregarded as the use of IQ and other standardized
testing became popular over the next eighty years. Since Binet&#8217;s time, IQ
and other standardized testing has been used to exclude children from
regular classes, to place them in restricted environments, to deny them
jobs, to sterilize them, to prevent their immigation, and to place many
other restrictions on their social and economic participation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legitimizing the value of intelligence (and education&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an achieved rather
than an ascribed characteristic) has made it possible to attach notions
of merit to social order. Meritocracy is simply a process by which society
gives out its rewards to those who have merit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The critical question is: who or what is worthy of merit?</p>
