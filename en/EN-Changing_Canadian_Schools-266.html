<p>She asked why Sue
could not take French, commenting that &#8220;all we do in French is repeat
words&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Sue can do that.&#8221; Her observations had an underlying truth which
few adults could explain away or discount. Consequently, Sue had
opportunities to participate in activities which adults would have
considered irrelevant or in conflict with her program. For instance, Sue
previously had to miss French so that she would have extra time to get
ready to go home on the bus. Kerri felt that Sue was as able as any
student to get ready in the allotted ten minutes. And, given the
opportunity, Sue was able.</p>

<p>Another student, Scott, also became Sue&#8217;s advocate. He seemed to be more
in tune with Sue&#8217;s needs than other peers.
Over the year, he went from being a volunteer to being truly fond of Sue.
His commitment to support Sue turned into a friendship. For Scott, the
experiences around helping Sue enlarged his vision of friendship and
expended his active contribution to the school community.</p>

<p>For some students, being in the support group provided them with a
relationship which compensated for some absence in their lives. Each of
us has primary relationships with parents or siblings which are a major
source of nurturing, love and acceptance. Some students, because of
divorce, alcohol abuse, or other situations, have had terrible
experiences with some significant relationships. These students often
become lonely and attention-seeking. This was the situation for some of
the students in Sue&#8217;s peer group; they were eager to overcome their
limited success with meaningful relationships and become involved again.
This seemed to spark their interest in Sue&#8217;s group. Over time, other
students found the group comfortable to be in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commitment made by students generally seen as loners and troublemakers
surprised teachers. One teacher said, &#8220;I would never believe that this
person would ever volunteer to help.&#8221;</p>
