<p>During the 1980s, the process of gradual, evolutionary
change in special education practice in Canada was subject to
increasing challenge. In this chapter we discuss three factors
[law, advocacy, and educational innovation] which, taken
together, have created in Canada a unique environment supportive
of fundamental change in how students with disabilities are
educated. These developments have resulted in the kind of
ambiguity and inconsistency in special education practice that
has been identified as being necessary for a paradim shift
(Skrtic, 1987). Whether or not this shift will be toward full
integration of students with disabilities will only become clear
over the next several years. We conclude our review of these
three factors with a brief discussion of the crucial role an
integrated educational program plays in preparing a student
with disabilities for life as an adult in the community.</p>

<p>The Special Committee on Social Policy Development of the New
Brunswick Legislature issued its Report on the Review of School
Integration on October 31, 1989. The report was issued following
five weeks of public hearings into school integrafion, during which
the twelve-member committee visited sixtythree schools and heard
more than two hundred fifty briefs presented by parents, members,
administrators, school boards, and other citizens.
The report&#8217;s recommendations in summary include the following:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The province should confirm its commitment to Bill 85,
which mandated the integration of special needs children
into the regular school system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education minister should clear up differences over
interpretation and implementation of the act and issue &#8220;clear directives
to all school boards.&#8221;</p>
