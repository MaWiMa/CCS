play with him in the plamumd at noon and recess ﬁme. This
interaction was made possible because the teacher realized
that having Patrick oﬂ‘to the side kept him apart and spechl,
and placﬂ barriers between him and his classmates. The
teacher also realized that having an adult between Patrick
and the students also meated a barrier, so she instructed the
teacher assistant tomove about the clam and asm'st other
students as well. This illustration also points out the impor-
tance of reciprocity. IfPatrick had not responded in some way
to the initiations of his peers, their attempts at interaction
would have diminished over time.
A Means of Communicating
Teachers are now exploring ways of promoting communica-
tion among students in the classroom. Non-disabled students
are learning how to use communication boards, gestures and
signs. computerized devices and eye contact to help students
who are unable to talk to their peers.
One teacher gave a student who uses an adaptive deviw an
opportunity to teach her classmates about its unique charac-
terisﬁcs. Mary, a senior high school student who has multiple
handicaps, uses her eyes and a specially desiped mmmunica-
tion board to make her needs known. She made a presentation
to sevc val high school classes about the organization of her
board and about how she used it to gain some control over her
life. Mary became the teacher for a time and, as a result of her
lesson, the students became interested in other forms of
communicative devices. They also were able to see Mary from
a diﬂhrent perspective. She was no longer a person of mystery,
but anotherteenager with aunique way of talkingtoherpeers.
Her teacher had created a way to highlight Mary's abilities
and to show that her desire to communicate her ideas ....a
dreams was the same as that of her fellow teens.
