Training in special education would be good, but I think more than training
it would be [necessary to have] experience in working with kids and being
a classroom teacher. I have used a lot of things, techniques and so forth,

the classroom.

This year I'm teaching a regular Grade 2 class. I wanted to experience what
it was like to teach in a regular class.
Otherwise, how can I give teachers advice on what they should be doing in
a classroom? I've never really taught twenty-seven or thirty kids all at
once before. How do I know how you can handle all those children plus make
provisions for a special needs student?
