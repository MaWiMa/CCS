<p><strong><em>REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTI-LEVEL INSTRUCTION</em></strong><br>
Multi-level instruction does not consist of strategies designed for use
only in certain situations. It is a process that can be developed across
the curriculum. Therefore, it requires a great deal of commitment and
planning by teachers. It does not require extensive training, although it
does challenge teachers to rethink material previously taught. It may
mean that a teacher must abandon lesson plans used many times before, and
be open to new approaches to that same material. It requires time to plan
new lessons and a willingness to give up the role of presenter for that
of facilitator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-level instruction requires movement away from a teacher-controlled
classroom and towards more choice and autonomy for students. It is a means
of meeting the needs of students at their level while also meeting the
needs of the curriculum. This however, entails a great deal of work on
the part of teachers. Why should teachers be willing to expend the energy
that is necessary to bring about these changes?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Rationale for Multi-Level Instruction</em></strong><br>
One rationale for multi-level instruction is that it encourages inclusion
and integration. At the same time it addresses different learning styles.
It allows teachers to reach all of the students some of the time (it is
not possible to meet all of the needs of the students all of the time).
However, the use of a variety of techniques within the same unit or lesson
eliminates the need to teach the lesson many different times, in many
different ways, to meet the individual styles of the students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The multi-level instruction approach does take students beyond the
knowledge and comprehension levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy. It allows for
enrichment for very able students as well as modification for students
who have difficulties in learning. It stresses cooperation among students
and allows evaluation at individual skill levels.</p>
