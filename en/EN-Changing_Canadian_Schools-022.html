<p>In 1986, a Nova Scotia couple, Rick and Maureen Elwood,
obtained a court injunction to keep their son Luke, who had
been labelled mentally handicapped since birth, in a regular
class in their neighbourhood school. They concluded that their
only chance of prevailing in their dispute over his placement
with the Halifax County School Board was to go to trial. School
officials firmly maintained Luke would he better served in a
segregated program. Their position that a range of placement
options was necessary depending on the student&#8217;s level of
disability was consistent with the concept of least restrictive
environment and the Cascade model, both typical of traditional
special education practice (Little, 1985). The department of
education did not intervene on their behalf.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Elwoods did not take this action lightly. They knew they
would face the tension and unease of challenging one of the
most established vested authorities in their community, the
educational system. As Jack Batten (1988) explains, they also
knew that inactivity on their part would mean a life of
isolation for their son:</p>

<p>Luke took gym and music classes with normal kids, but,
effectively, he was shut away in a ghetto of disabled
children. And as far as Maureen could make out, he might
pass the rest of his life in different corners of the
same ghetto. He&#8217;d never escape. He&#8217;d never grow. If Luke
was disabled, then the system seemed constructed to keep
him disabled.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dispute went on throughout the 1986-87 school year as the
school board refused to accept the principle of integration.
However, just hours before the case was to open before the
Queenâ€™s Bench division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, the
board initiated discussions that led to a settlement of the
dispute (Batten. 1988). The school board agreed to the parents&#8217;
demand and the result was a court-approved agreement
that assured Luke Elwood an integrated school program with
appropriate support (MacKay, 1987b).</p>
