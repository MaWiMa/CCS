Stages 2 and 3 permit team members to focus on defining the parameters
of the problem for the teacher. After the referring teacher provides 
a vignette of the situation and his or her concerns, team members may ask
for somes pecific examples of the behaviour, such as "`You find that
Susan is aggressive toward other children. Can you give me some specific
examples of her aggressive behaviour?`"

During stage 3, team members may:

. Look for factors that may trigger or maintain a problem; identify and
analyze conditions that alleviate the problem. +
("`Does Mary seem to work better when you... ?`");

. Look for consequences that may maintain the behaviour. They may explore
actions that are already occurring or could be instituted to improve
behaviour or performance. +
("`What do you do when Joe does complete all off his homework?`" "`What
types of things does Julie really like to do?`");

. Assess other factors in the student's environment. Significant people
in the student's environment are identified and asked questions to assess
their attitudes and expectations regarding the problem. Relevant
instructional variables and classroom or home routines are explored;

. Identify all available resources; identify the strengths of the child. +
("`What types of things does Jeff do well?`" "`In what subject area is
William succeeding?`")

The process of clarification helps make the problem specific enough that
team members feel they understand it clearly.
The facilitator provides input to pull the threads together so the team
has a mutual sense of the issues causing a problem for the referring teacher.
