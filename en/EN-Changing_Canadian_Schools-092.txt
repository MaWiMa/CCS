The ideology of segregation, while still very much alive, is now having
to hide and adopt new tactics. We believe that continued, consitent pressure
to apply our five principles can keep the segregationists on the run, and
help all those in our school systems who want to provide an appropriate,
inclusive education for all pupils.
