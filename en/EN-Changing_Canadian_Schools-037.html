<p>In our view, a more positive and constructive approach is in the interest
of concerned. The essential elements of this approach are the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The support the <em>Charter</em> offers for integated education should he
acknowleded and school authorites should initiate programs to develop and
implement such programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School authorities and professionals must work to develop real partnership
with parents, drawing on their visions for their children&#8217;s future, as
well as including them in meaningful way in actual program planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professionals engaged directly or indirectly in public education, such
as teachers, psychologists, social workers, and therapists need to develop
strategies for more effectiv collaboration to support a more inclusionary
educational program.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I went to a school &#8230;&#8203; that was not integrated. I was an adult when I had
my first encounter with on integrated person, and it happened to be my
own child. I think my idea of society was incorrect because I was not
allowed to have that experience &#8230;&#8203; I cannot see how there is a negative
aspect to learning something new, getting rid of a prejudice, learning
how to get along with someone who is different, whether mentally,
physically, or racially. I think that it is only positive.</p>
