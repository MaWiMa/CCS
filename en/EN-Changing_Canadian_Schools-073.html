<p>It changed its position to support the child&#8217;s claim that she had a right
to be integrated. This is thought to be the first time in the country
when an attorney general clearly came out in favour of the disadvantaged
person in a <em>Charter</em> challenge.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to claims to equality under the <em>Charter</em> and provincial or
territorial education legislation, some people have made complaints under
human rights. Two factors bring education under the domain of human
rights:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>despite conflicting legal judgements, schools have been held to be a
public service or facility under human rights legislation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in all provinces and territories, mental and physical disability are
prohibited grounds for discrimination. Anti-discrimination laws can address
policy and practice of people and organizations within both the public
and private sectors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basis of a complaint is that it is discriminatory to segregate
children because they have a mental disability in self-contained, &#8220;special&#8221;
schools or classrooms, as this denies them access to a public facility or
service (the school) that is customarily available to the public it serves
(children).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first human rights complaint involving a child with a mental handicap
that went to a hearing, was initiated on the basis of religious
discrimination. The Catholic school board in the county of Lanark, Leeds
and Grenville in Ontario required all children with mental handicaps to
attend one class operated by a secular school board. This meant that
Catholic children with a mental handicap could not receive instruction in
a separate school in the religion of their choice. The arrangement made
between the boards dictating that all &#8220;special needs&#8221; children would
be educated at one site was done for administrative convenience.</p>
