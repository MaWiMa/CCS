the class should he built in as much as possible. We must
acknowl% that students donot learn at the same rateorin
the same way, and we should be equally aware that one set of
goals is not apprewiate for all students. As logical as this
sounds, it is mmetimm diﬁcult for teachers to accept.
One of the mmt useful strategim for the classroom tmcher
is to desip lmons which permit mulﬁ-level parﬁcipaﬁon (see
Chapter 11). This means, for example, the while some stu-
knts are reading a novel, the child with a visual impairment
islisteningtoa tapedversion of the novel,whi1eotherstudents
with lower reading vocabularies mve access to a moﬁﬁed
version or a pmr reader. It moans that while one student
prepares a written report, another prepares a report orally or
with pictures.
Multi-level instruction promotes the use of questions de-
signed to address all of Blmnfs Taxonomy (Bloom,1%9) -
levels of cognitive diﬁculty developed by Benjamin Bloom, a
psychologst and educational theorist at the Umversity of
Chiw (see page 197). 'l‘herefere quesﬁnns wﬂl reach children
at diﬂerent 1% of understanding. Similarly, many learmw
tools, including cemputers,ca1culators and recorders, areencour-
aged and aompted so that all children om be involved.

Providing meaningful experienoes is one of the most interest-
ing aspects of teaching children with spwial needs. Because
many of the students I have worked with have had limited
understanding of their world, it is essential to meats situaﬁons
