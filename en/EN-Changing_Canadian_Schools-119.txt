Diplomacy is the big one because you have to be a diplomat
with parents, you have to be a diplomat with the other
teachers and you have to be diplomatic in your services to
the child. You have to be very careful that you're not treating
the child as something less than any of the other students in
the school. You have to be careful that you're not looking down
on the disabilities of the student. You have to make sure that
parents know that this child is just as importent as any other
child in the school. You have to make sure that you're making
your point clear and making the needs of the student clear to
the other teachers withou being a threat to them and their
secure environment in the classroom.

The M&R teachers interviewed repeatedly stressed they need to
be innovative, flexible, creative and observant. "`I get to know
the student by observing. Prior to an assessment, I go into the
classroom, and talk to them on the playground. I make a point
of being around them, watching their games.`" "`I never thought
I was, but I have to admit I find I'm getting more and more
creative as the year goes on. I'm not afraid to try something
different. I came up with ten ways for a teacher to plan a test
for a student. And they're successful.`"

They emphasized the need for good problem solving skills, for the
ability to have insight into a specific situation and see what
was really critical to its resolution. They talked about the
need to be alert and aware and to think quickly:

If you are a person with a mind-set that this is the way it should
be and it's the only way to do it, then you're going to have a lot
of stress because if one strategy doesn't work, you won't know what
to do next. You have to be able to say, "`I made a mistake and I
can't change that, but I can go on and do something else and try
to make it better`". And I think it's good if you can make other
people feel able to say, "`Big deal! It didn't work. We'll do
something different.`" The teacher has to be flexible as well.
