<p>Merit eliminates the need for measures that enable or ensure equality
because it is based on an acknowledgment and acceptance of the
&#8220;aristocracy of merit&#8221;. That means there are a few people who, because
of their superior intellectual qualities and their efforts, are born to
be leaders. It is assumed that there is a natural order where the welfare,
culture and progress of society depend on an aristocracy of these
intellectually skilled. The argument continues that social efficiency and
progress depend on rule by the elite of merit. Further, meritocratic rule
must be implemented with supremacy over all other social values:</p>

<p>The meritocatic assumption that efficiency (and civilization) depends on
inequality means that it is more important that human affairs be in the
hands of an energetic, capable, skilled elite than that every person has
an equal chance to rise in its ranks.</p>

<p>The school system has become the vehicle for sorting people this way. It
is less and less a place for educating people in the most important sense.
Because most people with mental handicaps are judged to have few natural
(innate) cognitive skills, they are simply denied, by definition, any
access to the meritocracy, to the rewards of society. The characteristics
they possess are not relevant or valued according to the standards of the
meritocracy. Effort without intelligence does not provide access to the
rewards of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over-valuation of certain forms of intelligence and experience has become
entrenched and reinforced through the public education system. This can
be seen in how the school system awards excellence in certain disciplines
and ignores competence in others. At its simplest level, the sciences are
much more relevant than the arts within the formal school system. At a
more complex level, the individual achievement of a person with a mental
handicap in accomplishing certain skills is often viewed as irrelevant.</p>
