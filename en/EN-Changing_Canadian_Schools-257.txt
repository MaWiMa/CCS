=== Beyond Behaviour: A Case of Social Intervention Strategies for a Student With Challenging Behaviours

_by Brian Kelly and Jeff den Otter_

As the integration of students with special needs has developed, people
have come to realize that, in order to be successful, an integrated
structure must he built on three components: physical factors, curricular
factors and social factors.
Social factors affecting strategies of inclusion are a unique challenge
and they need attention equal to that given to curricular and physical
concerns. In the following pages we describe the strategies used to
increase the social integration of a girl who has extremely challenging
behaviours. Her example illustrates the fact that effective intervention
strategies can improve the relationships and the lives of all children
with special needs.

==== SUE
This is the story of Sue, a young girl with special needs who had been
attending her neighbourhood school for four years. Even in a school
district with a five-year history of inclusion, Sue was considered an
exception because of her extremely challenging behaviours.
And despite the regular classroom setting, there
were concerns that her life differed too much from that of her peers.
