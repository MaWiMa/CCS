We found that IEPs were not necessary when our son had good, experienced
teachers who were committed to integration. We have also known parents
whose children have had poor teachers despite IEPs.

==== A WORD OF CAUTION
Although our principles are simple, putting them into practice is difficult.
Parents should be wary of people who promote simple answers to the complex
questions facing education today.

One potentially dangerous cry is "`back to the basics`". Any education system
built around the back-to-the-basics theme will be system-centred and
norm-referenced with no place for exceptional pupils. Securing a decent
education for exceptional children means supporting integation, with all
the inherent challenges involved. It means supporting theories and practices
that are called progressive, rather than those that are called conservative.

It is also important to realise that our society asks the impossible of
teachers and school administrators. We expect them to resolve all our social
problems and have all kinds of programs such as AIDS and anti-racism education
and propaganda from the nuclear industry. Integration means appropriate
education for _all_ pupils and is best accomplished when teachers are not
over-stressed.

Parents should support efforts to reduce class size, eliminate curriculum
overload and improve support services for teachers; parents should also
support rewards for exceptional teachers. Parents must resist any
postponement of integration based on the excuse that the system is not ready.
lf the time, effort and money spent opposing integration were spent implementing
it, integration would be a reality.

System-wide integration can work; good teachers and administrators have
discovered that they can integrate exceptional students much better
than they thought possible.
