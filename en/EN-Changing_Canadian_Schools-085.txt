Support from Research
Anotkr myth is that research supports traditional special
edumtiom. We looked at some of the womb used to support
spedal education and found that it was poorly dmigned, poorly
interpreted and not relevmrt to exisﬁng reality. In fact,
research today shows that it supports integration rather than
semgaﬁon for students with a disability.
Parents should question the quality and validity of
education research in general. Scienm is not objecﬁve and
research experiments are desiped to produce the results the
researcher wants to produce. Experiments are carried out by
pmple to get degrees, jobs, promotions or professional status.
In addition, education is an intensely personal interaction
between people whose moods and attitudes vary from minute
to minute. The use of adaptations of scientiﬁc methods
designed to study inanimate things seems inadequate for the
study of education.
The Holes in the Cascade Theory
Special education generally supports the model ofa continuum
of learning environments from total sepegation to total
integration in the regular classroom. Pupils are supposed to
progress along this mntinuum towards the regular classroom,
which they are supposed to reach eventually but never do. This
is the Cascade model, which it would be more appropriate to
call the “anywhere but in the regular classroom” model. It is
incredibly wasteful because the many different learning
environments must be staffed by special edumtion mrsonnel
and pupils must be brought in from far and wide to provide the
required numbers at each level. The real ﬁgures show that
most of the movement in the cascade is from less segregated
environments to more segregated environments and that it is
unusual for a pupil to progress successfully from a segregated
