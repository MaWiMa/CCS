<p>While it is true that an open-door policy is often threatening to teachers
trying new strategies to meet the needs of their integrated student, itis
equally true that two heads are better then one. An observer, such as another
staff member, can often shed light on factors in the classroom environment
which may be influencing the way a student is learning or behaving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integrated classroom teachers also have the right to be demanding. They
should ask for release time to attend workshops or to visit classrooms or
schools. They should request parent volunteers and aides. In some cases
extra preparation time is allotted or smaller class sizes given to teachers
who work in an integrated classroom. Administration should be made aware
that teachers need their support in the way of special resources and additional
support people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strategies outlined above are practised in classrroomsevery day. They are not
particular to an integrated classroom but are found wherever students and
teachers enjoy learning together.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has always been a characteristic of education that there has never
been enough time to get everything done. Today, even with advanced technology
surrounding us, it seems that more and more activities are cutting into our
precious minutes.
Each child needs time with the teacher, and teachers make conscious efforts
to interact with each student every day. But we never feel that we have
spent enough time with each student.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feelinq only increases when the class includes a child with spedal
needs. Because of their needs, they generally require even more one-on-one
attention.</p>
