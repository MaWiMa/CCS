==== STEP FOUR: METHOD OF EVALUATION
The fourth step in the process, the method of evaluation, is very closely
linked to the method of student performance and involves the same three
areas -- modes of studant performance, Bloom's Taxonomy and partial
participation. Students should he evaluated on their assignments with
equal weight being given to each mode of presentation. Written work is
not made more valuable than oral or artistic work. In this way, contributions
are of equal value and a student who cannot write is not devalued in the
eyes of the class.

Bloom's Taxonomy should he used in the development of test questions.
However, if different levels of questioning such as analysis, synthesis
or evaluation -- which are not typical test questions -- are included,
the student should be prepared for this type of questioning. It is not
appropriate to deal exclusively at the knowledge, comprehension, and
application level in the classroom and then expect students to make the
leap into the higher levels of thinking on test questions.

The main point to remember is that, in multi-level instruction evaluation
is based on the individual level of skill of the students.

==== SUMMARY
In multi-level instruction: a concept is determined; a variety of methods
of presentation are employed to meet all learning styles; choices are
given in assignments to allow all students to participate; and evaluation
of students is based on the individual ability levels of the students.
Multi-level instruction is a means of developing lessons that allow all
students to participate to their fullest extent, and be legitimate members
of the class.
