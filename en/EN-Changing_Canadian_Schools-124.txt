All theteachm saw areas theyneekdtolearn more about
including curriculum, instructional techniques and the needs
of inﬁvidual children. Some expressed conﬁdence in their
knowledge of regular classroom orgammtion and teaching
methods but felt they need more skill in assewent, testing
and development of appropriate indie ids al plans for students.
Another area in which many felt inadmuate was the develop-
ment of multi-level instructional techniques for use in the
regular class.
STRATEGIES FOR THE COLLABORATIVE ROLE
Methods and resource teachers reported using a variety of
strategies to support regular class teachers while avoiding
 themselves as experts who provide easy answers
to problems. They stressed the importanoe of being seen as
fellow-teachers and collaborators: ‘You can't ask a teacher to
do anything you wouldn't do yourself. You can't be an expert.
You have to be one of them.”
One strateg is to encourage the regular class teacher to
take ownership of both the problem and the plan to deal with it:
In September I thought I was going to do everything. I
thought I was going to be Miss Wonderﬁzi and do the
programs for the teachers, be so much of o help to them.
Then I realized, ‘Hey, I ‘m doing all of this; they’re not
taking ownership; they're thinking those kids are my
problem.’ So I had to go back and re-adjust my way of
doing things. I think ifs o lot better now that I keep the
role of the M &R teacher focused on omisting and being
there to assist, but not doing eueryth ing.
