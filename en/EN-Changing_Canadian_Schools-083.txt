Our ﬁlth principle, to make a gradual transition from school
to work, was developed when we realized that our son could
learn a skill in one setﬁng but could not necmsarily perform
that same skill in another mtting. This is called “low skill
transference ability” in jargon. We saw that sheltered
worhhops -— in which people with mental handicaps are
suppmedly trained forjoba in the real world — are almost total
failures.
Ourlocal school board was one step ahead of us and had set
up a emrk-study program for its pupils with a mental
handicap. ‘Work-study programs are vital if our children with
mental handicaps are to have a decent life. They cannot learn
about the real world of work while in school; they need
opportunities to learn how to work in the workplam itselﬂ.
Segregated schooling leading to segregated sheltered
workshops creates lives of dependency, frustration, anguish
and desperation in insﬁtutions. Children with handicaps
deserve much more than that.
THE CONFLIC-*1‘ BETWEEN PARENT
PRINCIPLES AND SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS
It is important to point out that our principles challenge a
number of basic assumptions about the way schools operate.
Although most of the teachers and administrators who had
direct responsibility For our son's education had appropriate
and sometin es phenomenal attitudes, we found major
problems at the system and structural let els. We were led to
think about these problems by system failures and the
experiences of other parents. In fact, our principles raise a
fundamental question that we thought had been resolved long
ago: are all pupils to be given a chance or ans some, as Gm:-ge
Orwell said, “mom equal than others”? There are educators
who still believe there should be gatekeepers armed with
“objective assmsments” to keep pupils with a mental handicap
separate from friends and peers. We also know principals,
