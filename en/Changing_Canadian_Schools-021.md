With few exceptions, Canadian school boards have generally offered
options that have become the standard both in this country
(Caapo and Goguen, 1980) and in the United States under public
Law 94-142 (Gartner and Lipsky, 1987):  

- "pull-out" resource room programs for students with mild
disabilities;
- segregated schools or segragated classes in regular schools
for students with moderate or severe disabilities;
- individual cases of integration for students with moderate
disabilities.  

However, while education is an area of provincial jurisdiction,
the context in which provincial education legislation operates
underwent a dramatic shift when the Canadian *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* was entrenched in the Canadian constitution 1982.
Several sections of the *Charter* have implications for policy
and practice relevant to the education of students with mental
and/or physical disabilities (McKay, 1984; Vickers and Endicott,
1985). It has been suggested that the aspects of education
legislation which are most subject to challenge under *the Charter*
are procedures for: student assessment and categorisation; placement;
the discretion to exclude students from regular classrooms;
and the very concept of segregated education (Robertson, 1987).
*The Charter* created a new environment in which the overriding
principles of liberty, freedom from discrimination, and freedom
of association set broad parameters within which education systems
must operate. Since the equality rights in *the Charter* did not
come into force until 1985, the assurance of equality rights
in many areas is still in the process of being established.
However, it is the opinion of some that segregated educational
programs are a natural target for litigation based on *the Charter*
(Donahue, 1988; MacKay, 1987a). In any event, there has been
an increased awareness of and sensi (from 22) tivity to the
question of school integration for students with disabilities.
