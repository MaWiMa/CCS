This article recounts the legal struggle of one family to obtain integrated
education for their son, Luke. It attributes the capitulation of the
school board, before court action, to a foundation of claims under the
_Charter of Rights_, expert testimony regarding integrated programming,
the principles of Luke's parents, and Luke himself, who "`blossomed and
grew`" during his one year of integrated schooling.

While it did not lead to a binding judicial agreement, this case will
provide valuable evidence in subsequent cases regarding education
integration as a right.

needs. _Today's Parent_, April, pp.34-40.* +
Casting the issue as a civil rights battle and a fight for the right to
belong, this article presents the struggles of a number of parents
fighting for community integration for their children. Successful
integration experiences at camp, at school and with other families are
contested with experiences of exclusion.

The author notes that, while some school boards in Ontario follow a policy
of full integration, only in New Brunswick is integration mandated by law
and practised province-wide.

Some Canadian resources for parents (organizations, videos, and books)
are listed at the end of the article.

national dilemma. _Homemakers`' Magazine_, May, pp. 11-20.*
This is the story of an Ontario family's legal battle to obtain integrated
school placement for their adopted daughter. The article presents the
views of those advocating Becky's inclusion in her neighbourhood school
and the opposing views of school board officials and others who believed
that her needs
would best be met in a segregated school with special staff and resources.
