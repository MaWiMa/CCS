These strategies cover the many facets of preparation for
and planning of inclusion, such as curriculum development
and problem-solving tactics.
Readers will notice that authors of the various chapters
have used many different terms to refer to the students
targeted in an inclusionary model, from "student with a
mental handicap" to "student with special needs" to
"exceptional student". These different terms actually reflect
the ongoing struggle with language. In a country as diverse
as Canada, people have conflicting views; what may be 
acceptable terminology in one area is seen as backwards and
regressive in other areas. Therefore, because the book reflects
the experiences of many people in integration, it also reflects
the state of the evolution of language and that diversity
of opinion.

In addition, many of the contributors to the book mention
that they look forward to a time when the word "integration"
will not be neccessary because the concept will simply be a
fact of life. This view is shared by people advocating for
inclusion who look forward to a day when the various "labels"
used to identify people through their differences are no
longer necessary. David Jory, the parent of a young man
labelled mentally handicapped (see Chapter 5) writes:

After all these years, I do not like to use the word
"integration" any more. The use of the word, however, is
necessary because, for far soo long, our school systems
have practised systematic discrimination against pupils with
a mental handicap. "Integration" is simply the process of
righting that wrong. I prefer to think of on integrated
schoolsystem in which the educational needs of all pupils
are met appropriately, and I hope that soon the word
"integrated" will be unnecessary. But we are not at that
stage yet.
