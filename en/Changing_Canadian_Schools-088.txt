Assessments ofﬁmeptional Students
Our ﬁve simple principles also call into question the
assment procedures on which special education foam. The

mental handicap is turned away at the front door of the
education system.
Our son has provﬁ wrong every such assmament he has
evm' had. But why did he have to? The gatekeepem turned him
away from the regular school system and it took him twelve
years to fully ﬁght his way hack in.
Whilein-class sssessmentsin the regularclmoom setting
can be useful in determining appropriate work levels,
assmments which claim to predict in detail what a pupil will
or will not be able to learn are dangerous. They, and the
rejection which follows them, have a devastating elfect on the
self-esteem of the pupil. Segregators do not seem to
unms-stand or cane.
Assessments asmciated with “plawments” are almost
invariably designed to ﬁnd out what the child cannot do,
rather than what he can do. Assessments are almost
invariably used against the child. Since the only acceptable
placement is in the regular classroom, predimive assessments
have no function and no ethical, educational or legal
justiﬁcation.
Some people who argue for assessments say that
exceptional pupils mustbe divided up into sub-categories such
as mentally retarded, physically disabled or with behaviour
problems. This is equivalent to setting up a category of
immigrant pupils and sub-dividing them into Christian black-
skinned, Christian bnown-skinned, Moslem brown-skinned,
and so on. ﬁhool systems should be sensitive to the education
needs of pupils as individuals, not as groups. Our son is more
like his brother and sister than like other children with Down
Syndrome. Them are no special teaching techniques that
apply only to pupils with Down Syndrome.
