<p>I later learned that Mandy&#8217;s presence had set a precedent; the
following year the school had three children with special needs enrolled
in regular classes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I arrived in New Brunswick I was consumed with mixed emotions. I
dreaded my new neighbours&#8217; reactions to our family; I feared that I would
have to explain and fight all over again. It was difficult to have left
everything that made me feel safe and secure: my family and my friends.
I felt a tremendous burden on my shoulders. Everything had been going so
great; and now I suddenly felt desperately alone!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it was upon moving to New Brunswick that I learned there was a special
word for my beflef that Mandy should and could participate in regular
classes with other neighbourhood children. The word is integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That September both kids started school&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Mandy in regular kindergarten
and Justin in Grade 5 at the same school.
While things were off to a smooth start, I soon heard that there was to
be a review of school policy regarding integration. A concerned teacher
at the school convinced me that it was important that parents like myself
become involved in the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I began making phone calls to other parents who were considering integating
their children. I explained to them that I had recently moved from Ontario
and, like them, had a child with special needs. I asked them if they new
that changes to school policy regarding integration of children with exceptional
needs were under review. We talked about how important it was that we as
parents contribute and voice our opinions and concerns. We agreed that we
needed to meet each other and discuss the impending changes which would
effect our lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every person I called&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which added up to ten families&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;came to a meeting
at my home.</p>
