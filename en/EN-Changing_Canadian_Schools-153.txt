==== NOTES ON THE STUDY
In January 1988, interviews were held with thirteen teachers who have worked
as methods and resource teachers in New Brunswick school districts 28 and 29.
Two of the thirteen were working in other capacities during the 1987-88 school
year and reflected on their previous experiences. The interviews were held
in the school where the teachers are on staff, and lasted from forty-five
to ninety minutes. The interviews were taped and the resulting transcripts
provided the information base for the study.

The study was based on qualitative research methods and utilised an inductive
approach. The interviews were openended and the teachers were free to take
the discussion where they wished. However, the focus of the interview was
on their work as methods and resource teachers.

Ten of the teachers completed a time-use log over two work days in the weeks
following the interview. They recorded their major activities for each
fifteen-minute time period while they were at school. These were used for
analysis of their actual work activities.

The information from the interviews and the time-use logs was used to generate
the research findings. Time-use logs were also completed by all methods and
resource teachers in 1989 and 1990. The results for 1990 are reported in
the charts A1 to A5. The analysis and synthesis involved extensive sorting
and organizing of the data to generate the themes that are described. The
findings are firmly "`grounded`" in the recorded views of the methods and
resource teachers.
