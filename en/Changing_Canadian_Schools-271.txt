Dr. John McGee pmpmed the use of Gentle Teaching as a
non-aversive technique for dealing with people who exhibit
challenging behaviours. He was brm@t to Canada by The
Roeher Institute to provide alternative approamu to punish-
ment uaed and accepted in the past to curtail swam and
self-injurious behaviour. These included the use of cattle
prods, noxious suhtances, and physiml and mechaniml re-
straints. Gentle Teaching focuses on three main assumpﬁons:
1. A human being has inherent value that is not contingent
upon productivity or behaviour;
2. A person’s participation with another person has value
that is not linked to, nor contingent upon, the person's
ability to complete a structured task;
3. Human interaction is reciprocal in nature and pmple mn
be taught a process of reciprom'ty.
These assumptions are based upon the idea of bonding and
friendship that is typiﬁed by trust and security. McGee sees
bonding and ﬁiendship as the bases for a relationship between
a person and the caregiver. Itis through our relationshim with
others that we work past a petson’s challenging behaviour.
Our desire for changing a person’s behaviour is secondary to
the care and respect we have to show for the individual.
Developing a trusting relationship is speciﬁc to each person
and the relationship is not transferable to other caregivers.
Each mregiver must make his own bond with the person.
We attended a week-long workshop in Nova Scotia on
Gentle Teaching and began to think that Sue could beneﬁt
from this alternative approach. It was our hope that by
oﬂering a workshop at the school, and by involving the people
closely associated with Sue, we might he able to get beyond
Sue's agressive behaviour toa point where we could establish
meaningful interactions with her.
