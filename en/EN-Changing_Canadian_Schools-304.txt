This chapter suggests effective strategies which can be employed by
principals, superintendents, and school board personnel to promote
integration. In order to act, the administrator must identify decision-
makers and mobilize leadership within the system.

Of particular interest is a section on eleven barriers to integration
(such as attitudinal, jurisdictional, administrative, political) and the
promising practices which address these barriers.

One of the keys to a successful integration program is a strong
administrative commitment to integration together with effectively
mobilized support at the classroom level. This article offers ten
important considerations for school principals who are planning for
integration.

in regular neighbourhood schools. Of those surveyed, 34 per cent were

per cent had positive views.
