==== PARENTS, PARTNERS
Many segregotionists within school systems cannot accept our principle
that "`the expert on a pupil is usually the parent`". In fact,the way a
person in the education system responds to that principle is often a good
indication of that person's openness to integration. Many good teachers
and administrators welcome the participation of parents, and other support
personnel, in the overall educational enterprise. Other teachers and
administrators say they fear a loss of control over the classroom.
Or they seem to reject the idea that parents have anything useful to otfer.
These fears should be dealt with sympathetically because the successful
education of a pupil with a mental handicap and, increasingly, of other
pupils, _requires_ parent-teacher-administrator cooperation.

We find these fears are based on emotion rather than fact, and there is
plenty of experience to show that the fears are generally unfounded. One
of the most heart-warming aspects of our efforts over the years was seeing
some teachers who were afraid of "`integration`" become its strongest
advocates once they tried it.

We feel teachers and administrators have developed their fears through
incorrect information and attitudes taught by faculties of education. In
many cases, we see the teachers and administrators as the victims of _their_
education. We find that the faculties of education of all but a handful
of our Canadians universities desperately cling to outdated segregationist
ideology and concepts based on out-of-date research. They refuse to give
teachers the training they need to enable them to provide an appropriate,
integrated education for _all_ pupils. We have come to the sad conclusion
that most faculties of education are incompetent in this major area. On
the other hand this means that we, as parents, should be prepared to help
and support willing teachers and administrators who want to do the right
thing but do not know how.
