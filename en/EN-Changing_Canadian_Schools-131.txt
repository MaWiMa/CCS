I'm still the one that parents call. The regular teachers haven't made any
effort to get in touch with the parent just to find out how they can work

We've had parents in for planning sessions and we get very beneficial information
from them. Parents have just provided us with so much information that has helped
in planning for the students. For example, they said their child likes to
do this or he really enjoys doing that. To get from the parents the things
that have occurred [at home] is very helpful.

We discuss the programs with the parents. We ask them for suggestions, what
they would like and then we try to incorporate those suggestions as much
as we can into the program. We maintain close contact with parents. The
teachers maintain that contact as well.
