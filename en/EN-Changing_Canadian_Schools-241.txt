Cooperative Learning
Cooperative learmngﬁ is an effective strateg that provides
opportunities for students with  to mrticipate and
build relationships with their non-disabld peers. Oooperaﬁve
learning involves structuring leaning tasks so that smdents
work together in small 9-cum to achieve shared academic
gos1s(-Johnson, Maruyama,Johnm Nelson and Skon, 1981).
Students are accountable and responsible for their own
mhievement, as well as for the performance of the other
members of their group. They also practise sodal roles as they
work to solve problems, learn new material or create projects
and documents.
Incentives are built into oooperaﬁve learning activities to
enmurage children in the group to work together to teach each
other components of the lesson. By using criterion-refenenmd
evaluation, teachers can modify and individualire goals to ﬁt
certain students‘ abilities without jeopardizing evaluation for
the group (Campbell, Campmll, Collicott, Perner and Stone,
1988).
