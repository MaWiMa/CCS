<p>These strategies cover the many facets of preparation for and planning of
inclusion, such as curriculum development and problem-solving tactics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Readers will notice that authors of the various chapters have used many
different terms to refer to the students targeted in an inclusionary model,
from &#8220;student with a mental handicap&#8221; to &#8220;student with special needs&#8221;
to &#8220;exceptional student&#8221;. These different terms actually reflect the
ongoing struggle with language. In a country as diverse as Canada, people
have conflicting views; what may be acceptable terminology in one area is
seen as backwards and regressive in other areas. Therefore, because the
book reflects the experiences of many people in integration, it also
reflects the state of the evolution of language and that diversity of
opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, many of the contributors to the book mention that they look
forward to a time when the word &#8220;integration&#8221; will not be necessary
because the concept will simply be a fact of life. This view is shared
by people advocating for inclusion who look forward to a day when the
various &#8220;labels&#8221; used to identify people through their differences are
no longer necessary.

<p>After all these years, I do not like to use the word &#8220;integration&#8221; any
more. The use of the word, however, is necessary because, for far too long,
our school systems have practised systematic discrimination against pupils
with a mental handicap. &#8220;Integration&#8221; is simply the process of righting
that wrong. I prefer to think of on integrated schoolsystem in which the
educational needs of all pupils are met appropriately, and I hope that soon
the word &#8220;integrated&#8221; will be unnecessary. But we are not at that stage yet.</p>
