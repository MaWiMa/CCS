<p>Continuing controversy over integration and intensive pressure
from the province&#8217;s teachers&#8217; union had prompted the minister of
education in May 1989, to mandate this committee with the task of
reviewing the integration process that has been under way in New
Brunswick since  the passage of Bill 85 in 1986. Union leaders
had maintained that integration was putting New Brunswick&#8217;s already
strained education system at risk of collapse. The president of the New
Brunswick Teachers&#8217; Association claimed that  &#8220;integration is
turning classrooms into zoos&#8221; and creating conditions in which
&#8220;teachers can&#8217;t teach and students can&#8217;t learn&#8221; (Benteau, 1989).
The union insisted that the &#8220;horror stories&#8221; of integration be
made public and that the issue be included in their negotiation
of a new collective agreement (Richardson, 1989). As a result, the
committee&#8217;s strong support for the integration process came as a
surprise to many and as a relief to advocates for students with
disabilities.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While provincial legislation in Canada requires school boards to
provide educational services to students with disabilities, how
the service is delivered is generally left to the discretion of
local school authorities. In Ontario, the passage of Bill 82 in
1980 raised parents&#8217; hopes that integrated programs would be easier to
achieve, but that has not been the result.
Both British Columbia and Alberta have recently revised their
legislation governing schools, but the right of a student
with disabilities to placement in a regular class with his or her
nondisabled peers is not assured.</p>
