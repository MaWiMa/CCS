<p>In fact, because of the inclusion of self-advocates the association
changed its name in 1985 from the Canadian Association for the Mentally
Retarded to the Canadian Association for Community Living.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immediately after the change of name, the association embarked on an
eighteen-month review of its goals and objectives. After consulting with
its membership in ten provincial, two territorial and over four hundred
local associations, the organization developed a plan entitled
<strong>Community Living 2000</strong> which described a vision for the year 2000. The
vision is of individuals supported by a network of family and friends;
they have opportunities to attend regular neighbourhood schools and be
included in regular classrooms; they have meaningful work and control
over the tax dollars being spent on their behalf; they have opportunities
to develop a personal lifestyle and receive reliable support when they
need it. This vision is shared by self-advocates, families, and members
of the association-at-large. The vision is anchored in several principles
which the association identified as critical in order to achieve true and
full participation in their communities by all individuals, regardless of
handicap. They are citizenship, membership and self-determination.
Citizenship is the actualization of rights without discrimination. It
encompasses voting, having equal opportunities for employment, and being
entitled to due process of law whether as a victim, a witness or an
accused. Membership is a sense of belonging: having friends and families
through good times and bad. Self-determination is the ability to chart the
course of one&#8217;s life: to choose with whom and where to live; to have a
choice of career; and to choose the individuals who are providing support
for activities in daily life.</p>
