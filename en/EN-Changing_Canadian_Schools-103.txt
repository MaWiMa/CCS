Looking back, I have no regrets as to the path we chose for Mandy. As
pioneers in our educational system and as advocates for the acceptance of
people with differences into communities, our pleasure and success came
in our relationship with our daughter. As parents we were only catalysts,
providing her with the opportunities to build and develop friendships at
school and in the community. Yet many times I asked myself, "What do I
really want for Mandy?" One day, as I looked out my front window, I knew.

There, as the wind whistled about and the ﬁrst snow ﬂurry of the year danced
in the air, two little girls sat with their jackets off. They knew that
they weren't allowed to have their coats off but it was fun. As they laughed
and played on the lawn swing they tried to catch snowﬂakes on their tongues.
Suddenly, overwhelmed, tears began to stream down my face. I said out loud,
"_This is what it is really all about!_ This is the kind of life I want
for both my children. This is the future. A future where integration is
no longer an issue but a fact of life."

I have learned never to "judge a book by its cover". I have learned that
change is not easy and it does not happen over night. You have to make it
happen!
