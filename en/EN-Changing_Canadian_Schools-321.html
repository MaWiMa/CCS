The positive experience of partial integration in Grade 7 led the parents
of Yvonne Penner to request a totally integrated Grade 8 program at her
St.Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland school. This article describes Yvonne&#8217;s
accomplishments in communication skills, interpersonal relationships, and
educational goals.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her parents conclude, &#8220;We commend the school board for taking the
courageous step of total intqration and not falling into the readiness
trap. Children are always ready&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they just need the appropriate
supports.&#8221;</p>

This article follows five children whose preschool years included
intensive developmental programming in their own homes as part of the
Gateway Residential Intensive Training (G.R.I.T.) program in Edmonton,
Alberta. The children, who have severe handicaps, are successfully
integrated into regular primary school classes. The article notes that,
&#8220;As long as adequate supports are provided, the viability of such an
educational option is no longer in question.&#8221;</p>
