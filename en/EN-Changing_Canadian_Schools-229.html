<p>Teachers should choose the least complex and intrusive intervention.
Where possible, the focus should be on helping the referring teacher modify
instruction or general behaviour management strategies. Making changes to
techniques the teacher already uses is intrusive or aversive to the
teacher than learning a new procedure (Axelrod, 1990);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a new skill must be developed by the teacher, it should be designed
to fit into the present classroom structure and routine as much as possible
(Conoley and Conoley, 1988).</p>

<p><strong>Stage 6:</strong> The facilitator establishes a plan to follow up on the ideas
or strategies that have been selected by the teacher. This might include
arranging for more detail on a specific idea, providing assistance in
further developing a plan of action, or setting a date for a future
meeting to evaluate the plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The roles and responsibilities of all participants must be assigned and
agreed upon. All aspects the plan should be put in writing, at least in
outline form, so each person involved has a clear idea of his or her
responsibilities. The specific techniques to be used should be set out
step-by-step in the outline.
The time of day and the settings or subject area in which the intervention
will be implemented must be decided. This written plan also serves as a
record for people&#8217;s accountability.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage 7:</strong> The facilitator thanks team members and ensures that all
participants leave feeling that something constructive will come from
the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers always have favourable comments regarding problem-solving
meetings. They appreciate the variety of practical suggestions that
result from the meeting. They are pleased that it only takes thirty
minutes from beginning to end.</p>
