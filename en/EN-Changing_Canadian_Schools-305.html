Toronto: Canadian Education Association.</strong><br>
Based on a cross-Canada survey, this paper discuses many of the issues
facing school boards in developing and maintaining integrated programs.
Respondents noted trends toward services based on specific needs rather
than on category of handicap, and toward full rather than partial
integration. Major concerns about integration centred around issues of
teacher preparation, teacher confidence, and the provision of adequate
support services to teachers.</p>

This author describes a new integration, namely, the integration of the
special education service system into a new, total education service
system. He summarizes the legal basis for school integration in the
United States and makes a distinction between following the spirit and
following the letter of the law. Eight key administrative strategies are
outlined for facilitating a high quality education system for all students,
regardless of the presence or severity of handicap.</p>
