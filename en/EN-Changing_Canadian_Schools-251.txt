the rope. By slowing the rope down as it neared the ground,
Jane could step over it without becoming twisted in it and
falling down.
Jane and the students kept count of her successful steps,
and Jane’s mm terminated when she failed to step cleanly
over the nope. Then, much toJane’s surprise, she was required
to swing the nope for the other players. This also turned out to
be an excellent form of phydcal therapy for Jane. The relation-

Friendship Circles
People have found friendship circles (Snow and Forest, 1987)
to be an etfwtive way ofbuilding relaﬁonships among children
or young people. To form a friendship drcle, students who are
interested in being involved in the life of a fellow student are
brought together ona team. With the gm'dance of an interested
md sensitive adult, these students help make decisions and
plans for and with the individual. They become involved with
the student on a personal basis both inside and outside the
school. They brainstorm ways ofincluﬁng the student in their
own and other soda] circles. They identify barriers that
prevent the student from participating in a particular setting
or activity and then work together to break the barriers down.
This is not o ‘special/h'endspmj'ect'ora ‘buddy system’
for “unfortunate"students, ore chance for students todo
o good deed for the day. The circle of friends is a network
that allows for thegenuine involvement of children in o
ﬁiendship. caring. and support role with their peers.
