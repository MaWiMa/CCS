Certain practices appear to be associated with successful schooling of
students in heterogenous (mixed ability) groupings. These include:
outcome-based instructional models; creative use of peers; multi-age
groupings and in-service training which consciously promotes common
conceptual frameworks, kowledge and language among school staff.

This article places integration issues in the context of overall school
reform by asking the critical question, "`Are schools organized in a way
to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse student population?`"

The authors promote a change from a self-contained special education
classroom model of service delivery to a more integrated approach in
which special education is a service and support provided in general
education environments. To achieve overall change, integration should
adhere to natural proportions, identify and use natural supports, use a
participation approach and demonstrate success locally. School-level
strategists should identify all collaborators, communicate with all
members of the school community, and share space.
