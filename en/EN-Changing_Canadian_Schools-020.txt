- The education minister should immediately give school boards the funds they need to meet the requirements of the bill.
- More training on teaching exceptional children should be provided to teachers and ... should provide more such training
in their education programs.
- The education minister should provide leadership by accenting the successes and positive points of integration (Committee
reports, 1989).

Continuing controversy over integration and intensive preasure from the province´s teachers´
union had prompted the minister of education in May 1989, to mandate this committee with the task of
reviewing the integration process that has been under way in New Brunswick since 
the passage of Bill 85 in 1986. Union leaders had maintained that integration was putting New Brunswick´s already
strained education system at risk of collapse. The president of the New Brunswick Teachers´ Association claimed that 
"integration is turning classrooms into zoos" and creating conditions in which
"teachers can´t teach and students can´t learn" (Benteau, 1989).
The union insisted that the "horror stories" of integration be
made public and that the issue be included in their negotiation
of a new collective agreement (Richardson, 1989). As a result, the
committee´s strong support for the integration process came as a
surprise to many and as a relief to advocates for students with
disabilities.  

While provincial legislation in Canada requires school boards to
provide educational services to students with disabilities, how
the service is delivered is generally left to the discretion of
local school authorities. In Ontario, the passage of Bill 82 in 1980
raised parents’ hopes that integrated programs would be easier to
achieve, but that has not been the result.
Both British Columbia and Alberta have recently revised their
legislation governing schools, but the right of a student
with disabilities to placement in a regular class with his or her nondisabled peers is not asured.
