*Stage 4:* Once the problem has been clearly defined and analyzed, a range
of possible interventions must be generated. A round-table brainstorming
session is held to generate suggestions from team members as to how the
problem may be solved. Brief, practical statements are encouraged, and
are directed to the facilitator.The referring teacher does not interact
with others at this stage.

The central rule of this phase of the process is to avoid evaluating
ideas until the brainstorming segment is completed. There is often more
than one way to rsolve a problem, and by generating a number of possible
solutions the team is more likely to come up with an intervention that
is both effective and acceptable to the referring teacher.

Team members usually suggest some change in classroom management or
instructional strategies in areas like curriculum content, rewards or
instructional techniques. They may also suggest changes to teacher
behaviour, peer and sibling behaviour, and the physical arrangement of
the classroom +
(Gutkin and Hickman, 1990).

*Stage 5:* The facilitator and the referring teacher go over the
suggestions and strategies together. The referring teacher evaluates them
to determine how beneficial they will be for the child and how feasible
it is to implement them. The ultimate selection of strategies rests with
the referring teacher who is asked to rate each suggestion by assigning
a number to it: +
number 1 is an idea or strategy that the teacher wants to try
immediately; +
number 2 is an idea or strategy that has merit, but is not a priority;
and +
number 3 is an idea or strategy that has already been tried or is not
seen as immediately practical by the referring teacher. +
When rating strategies, teachers should keep in mind:

. Interventions should focus on the positive rather than on control and
suppression of challenging behaviour;
