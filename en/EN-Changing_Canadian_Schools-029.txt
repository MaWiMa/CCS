The proliferation of early intervention programs in the last decade has
raised the expectations of parents about the potenfial of the potentional
of their  children to learn and develop. Participation in integrated day
care, nurseries and kindergartens has created parental expectations that
their children would continue to be educated in the regular stream.


[quote, Crealock, 1989]
____
Early intervention provides [excellent] support and information for
families with children who show a delay. Matthew [who was born with Down
Syndrome] was enrolled when he was a day old. We all worked to see that
Matthew achieved all his milestones as soon as he could. We pushed him
to be the very best he could be... Matthew did everything my other
children did; maybe not as fast, but he succeeded. When Matthew was three
he went to preschool... two mornings a week. Matthew, at four years, was
enrolled in a kindergarten four mornings a week...  In his fifth year,
Matthew attended French immersion kindergarten and [he] is now in [a]
Grade 1 regular class... Matthew is in school to learn to be the best he
can be. He is not [there to be] dumped or babysat.

Furthermore, parents who see their children with disabilities participating
fully in other aspects of community life cannot accept that they should
have to travel out of their neighbourhoods, often at great distance, to
attend school. Maureen Elwood acknowledged that this separation from
peers was one of the major concerns that led to the family's militancy:
// What's happened is that Luke's been alienated from everyone around him...
// It starts first thing in the morning. --> page 30
