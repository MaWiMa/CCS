<p>I&#8217;m still the one that parents call. The regular teachers haven&#8217;t made any
effort to get in touch with the parent just to find out how they can work
with them. There should be a lot more, but I think it all ties to the fact
that the regular teachers still don&#8217;t see these kids as their responsibility.
Even the parents don&#8217;t see the regular classroom teacher as responsible.
They still see me because they&#8217;ve dealt with me for three or four years.</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties, the value of parent participation in program
planning for students is most apparent. The parents&#8217; aspirations and visons
for the child&#8217;s future are important and need to be incorporated into the
overall program planning. Some schools ensure that parents are involve in
initial planning to the extent that their goals for the child are a basis
for the school program:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve had parents in for planning sessions and we get very beneficial information
from them. Parents have just provided us with so much information that has helped
in planning for the students. For example, they said their child likes to
do this or he really enjoys doing that. To get from the parents the things
that have occurred [at home] is very helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We discuss the programs with the parents. We ask them for suggestions, what
they would like and then we try to incorporate those suggestions as much
as we can into the program. We maintain close contact with parents. The
teachers maintain that contact as well.</p>
