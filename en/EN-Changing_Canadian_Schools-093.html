<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>by Alene Steinbeck</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many dimensions to every story of integration: one that is often
overlooked is the impact on family life. What does integration mean on
the human level, away from school board meeting and resource teachers?
Every family experiences joys and trials in the course of their child&#8217;s
development: the first day of school, the move to a new neighbourhood and
a new school, the formation of new friendships. What dimension does the
constant struggle for inclusion in the regular school system add to these
experiencies?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My family&#8217;s story shows integration from this perspective&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one which is
often overlooked. It is the story of education and of how education leads
to many other things in life. It is a story of friendship, love, community
and the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I realize, as I look back at my earlier experiences and education, that
I never had the opportunity to know people who talked or walked differently
from me, or who were labelled mentally handicapped, or who used a wheelchair.
I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to feel natural or confident around people
who were different from myself. My entire generation lacked this experience,
which led many of us to believe that people with differences did not belong
in our community; they belonged somewhere else, some place &#8220;special&#8221;.</p>
