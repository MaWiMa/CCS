mainstreaming. <em>Journal of Visual Impairment and Blindness</em>,

The author collected opinions of teachers, students, parents and
principals concerning the most important factors in successful
mainstreaming for students with visual handicap. Factors identified
included peer acceptance and interaction, flexibility of the teacher,
academic achievement, positive self-image, independence and inner
motivation in the student, family acceptance, available school support
personnel and adequate supplies and equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Booth, T. and P. Potts (Eds.). (l983). <em>Integrating Special Education</em>.
Oxford: Basil Blackwell.</strong><br>
This text presents viewpoints on how integration should be implemented
in Great Britain. Methods and issues include cooperative teaching, the
use of itinerant remedial teachers, resource bases within ordinary
schools, out-of-class activities, administrative changes, behaviour
modification, and support services. While contributors differ somewhat
in their strategies, all start from the position that educational
integration is a proper and viable goal.</p>
