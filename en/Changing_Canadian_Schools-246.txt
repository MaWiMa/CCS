Cross-Age Tutoring
Some teachers successfully employ crms-age tutors —- older
students who assist younger students with their work. Older
students may read to their young peers, listen to them read,
or assist them with story writing or math. Although this
technique requires more time to set up because teachers are
needed to assist tutors in preparing activities and presents-
tion strategies, teachers remark that the result is well worth
the effort. Tutoring gives older students the opportunity to
analyre andthinkthroughaparticularskilloractivityatadeeper
level than they would ordinarily. Teachers remark that students
me oﬁen better than teachers at explaining an idea or procedure
bmause young people relate so well to one another.
Croas-age tutoring also provides excellent opportunities
for students who are experiencing learning diﬂiculties them-
selves to support and help other schoolmates. The tutoring
provides older students with opportunities to practise certain
lessons and to be on the giving side of a relationship during
school. Teachers using this technique remark on how it be-
neﬁts the tutors' self-esteem and how this feeling carries over
into their general self-conﬁdence.
