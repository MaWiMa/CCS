=== The Role of the Classroom Teacher

_by Margaret Murray_

Other than being a parent, I cannot think of a position in which a person
wears as many hats as that of a teacher. Not only are the roles of the teacher
numerous and varied, but a teacher must switch from one to another spontaneously,
smoothly and professionally.

The inclusion of students with a mental handicap in a regular classroom
does not, in my opinion, create new roles for the teacher. It does, however,
require a honing of existing skills, and a reassessment of traditional
practices and attitudes.

The primary role of a teacher is, as always, to teach; but integration
broadens the focus to include an examination of what we are really teaching,
in the general sense, and how we are teaching it. This broadening of vision
is challenging, frightening and exciting, all at the same time. The combination
of such strong emotional forces should jolt us out of our complacency, out
of the secure niche we have made for ourselves. If all the support systems
are in place and the teacher's focus is positive, teachers and students alike
grow and benefit from the experience. The secondary role of the teacher,
therefore, is to respond professionally to the challenge, fear, and
excitement of teaching all children.
