Certain practices appear to be associated with successful schooling of
students in heterogenous (mixed ability) groupings. These include:
outcome-based instructional models; creative use of peers; multi-age
groupings and in-service training which consciously promotes common
conceptual frameworks, kowledge and language among school staff.</p>

an integrated education for middle school students with severe disabilities.
<em>Remedial and Special Education</em>, 11(5). pp. 6-16.</strong><br>
This article places integration issues in the context of overall school
reform by asking the critical question, &#8220;Are schools organized in a way
to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse student population?&#8221;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authors promote a change from a self-contained special education
classroom model of service delivery to a more integrated approach in
which special education is a service and support provided in general
education environments. To achieve overall change, integration should
adhere to natural proportions, identify and use natural supports, use a
participation approach and demonstrate success locally. School-level
strategists should identify all collaborators, communicate with all
members of the school community, and share space.</p>
