<p>Schoolboards in the two districts agreed to allow an extra professional
development day before the end of the school year for in-service training.
Each school was allowed to choose its own day within certain time parameters.
District staff responsible for assisting in the training attended these
school-based training sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The selected teachers were brought together for a full-day training
session. They were then asked to practise the techniques of the multi-level
approach in their own classrooms. Selected lesson were viewed and  feedback
given by schoolboard staff. A second training day was provided to allow
for planning for the school training sessions. The teachers had the freedom
to present the material according to their own plan, although there had
to be a common outline to assure consistency across the schools.</p>

,
principals, and vice-principals received training in the fundamentals of
multi-level instruction so they could act as support personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The principals and vice-principals were responsible for developing a
plan to provide ongoing in-service training to the rest of the staff in
their school. The main focus was training in small groups with collaboration
among teachers; the groups also had time to develop and implement the newly
acquired skills. Principals and vice-principals supported the training by
monitoring the skills when they observed teachers as part of teacher
supervision; they also provided ways for teachers to share strategies at
various staff gatherings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was the ongoing responsibility of district staff to monitor the
implementation of the plans and provide assistance as requested.</p>
