==== CONCLUSION
My goal has been to show the simplicity of integration. In fact, so much
of what has been described here is already accomplished well by teachers
every day in clasrooms everywhere.

Any teacher who believes it is his or her professional responsibility to
accept and teach all children will find a way to make integration work. Any
teacher who believes it is his or her personal responsibility to uphold
the value of all children will do so.
