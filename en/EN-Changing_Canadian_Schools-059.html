<p>Once a person has access to education, which is said to be available for
all, it then follows that the student&#8217;s personal ability is reflected in
how well the student does at school. If the student does well it is
assumed that he or she should be rewarded both in school and in the
opportunities he or she has based on his or her performance at school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What realities challenge the myth that education is equitable? It has been
shown over and over again that the quality of education varies significantly
from one school to another, and evan within each school In most cases the
quality depends on how closly a child approximates the ideal student on
which the school curriculum and pedagogical methods are structured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Curriculum is usually based on the prsumption that the child&#8217;s intellectual
&#8220;raw matter&#8221;, outlined in popular taxonomies, is more or less the same
for all students and, therefore, equally shared by all students. This
presumption forms, to a large extent, the distinguishing features of the
&#8220;ideal&#8221; student who is targeted by the education system through the
curriculum content and pedagogical methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In cultivating these intellectual properties, the purpose of the education
system is to bring the &#8220;ideal&#8221; student, latent in every child, from the
potential to the actual state. This is like assuming that every kernel of
corn starts off with the same potential to be a perfect piece of popcorn.
Of course, this is a circular argument based on the false presumption that
natur distributes intellectual raw matter in an equitable manner in the
first place. But, as we know, not every kernel of corn has the same potential
to pop, for many reasons. Even if all kernel are subjected to the same
conditions of heat, oil and distribution in the pot, they will not
necessarily pop in an identical manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The self-fulfilling prophesy inherent in this process should not be overlooked.
When it is argued that a supposedly fair spectrum
of qualities will be targeted in education, and when students rise to those
expectations, there is an illusion that people are being educated properly
and that people who fail are legitimately failures. The structure of the
process makes it difficult to ask whether the narrow spectrum of intellectual
properties targeted are the entire range properties on which education
ought to focus.</p>
