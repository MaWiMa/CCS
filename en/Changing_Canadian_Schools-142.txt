Again, however, direct experience seems to he the key to
 a fear of the unknown. Ones the teacher gets to
how the shrdent and begins to experience the suomss of
intepation, attitudes begin to change.
One of the M&R teachers noted an interesting ambiguity
batwmn the way some teachers talk about integraﬁon and the
way they ad. She auto that while some teachers still say
they are opposed toit, their actions aren't consistent with their
words:
Even though you hear them saying things Qoinst
[integration], their actions don't support what they're
saying. I think people are still afraid ofsoying in ﬁont
of their mars, ‘Well, maybe it's not such o bad thing.’

The attituhs of teachers in districts 23 and 29 have been
chi for the positive. One M&R teacher surveyed the
opinions of teachers in her school about integration. She
reportd that twenty-four of the thirty teachers responded and
only two of the twenty-four teachers indicated they did not
think that mudents should he integrated. Although a few
oontinued to have negative attitudes about the intepation
process, twelve of the twenty-four said that their attitudes had
changed and nine of the twelve reported that their attitudes
were more positive.
