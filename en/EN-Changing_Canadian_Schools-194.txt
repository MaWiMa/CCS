* allowing that some students will need adjusted expectations;
* giving students a choice in what method they will use to
demonstrate their understanding of the concept being taught;
* accepting that these different methods are of equal value;
* evaluating students based on their individual differences.

==== THE FOUR-STEP PROCESS IN DEVELOPING A LESSON
In order to develop a lesson that meets these objectives,
teachers may use the following four-step process as a guide:

. identify the underlying concepts;
. determine the teacher method of presentation (teaching style, questioning
techniques, partial participation);
. determine the student method of practice (allowing for variation in
assignments based on Bloom's Taxonomy, different presentation modes, and
partial participation);
. determine the method of student evaluation (considering different levels
of skill and accepting a variety of evaluation procedures).

==== STEP ONE: IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERLYING CONCEPTS
The first step is to identify the underlying concepts to be taught within
a unit or a particular lesson. It is important to understand that underlying
concepts are not merely the objectives established for a particular course.
Objectives may be only part of a much broader picture.

Teachers must identify, in the material they are teaching, what they would
like all the students in the class to understand when the lesson has
been completed.
