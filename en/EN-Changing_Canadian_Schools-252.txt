Circles meet regularly to plan outings and activities and to discuss the
things they have learned about themselves and others. Just as real friendships
grow, evolve and change, teachers have found that the composition and
personality of friendship circles change over time. This fluidity is expected
and allowed. Teachers involved in successful friendshipcircles are aware
of the natural ebb and flow of affection, attention and activity. They note,
however, that a core of students usually stays together for long periods
of time, which attests to the permanence and mutuality of the friendships
created.

==== AVOIDING PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

Teachers and parents voice their concern that, despite inschool successes,
a young person with a disability usually does not have "`real friends`".
As one high school teacher summarized:

[quote, Young, 1990]
____
For all that Doug is involved in the life and activities of the school,
with all the friends and acquaintances he has here, after school he goes
home and sits in front of the TV ... rarely does he go out; rarely does
anyone call.
____

Both parents and teachers express dismay that outside school hours their
children and young people spend long inactive periods of time without
seeing anyone outside their immediate families or the paid professionals
in their lives. Isolation, loneliness and boredom are still realities for
many. When people with disabilities talk about their lives and what is
missing, they repeatedly point to the difficulty of building and maintaining
lasting friendships. They talk about the need to feel that their lives
touch others in important ways, and the need to know that their existence
makes a positive difference.
The physical and social barriers imposed by society, which for years
separated and devalued people with disabilities, are hard to break down.
