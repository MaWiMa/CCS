==== 2.2 Teacher Preparation and Teacher Attitudes
*Csapo, M. and D. Baine. (1985). Teachers of students with severe
handicaps. _Canadian Journal of Exceptional Children_, 1, pp. 130-135.* +
The authors describe the demands that deinstitutionalization has placed
on regular and special education teachers and administrators. They also
present the results of a recent Canada-wide survey of programs which
prepare teachers and others to work with students who have severe and
multiple handicaps.

*Darvill, C.E. (1989). Teacher attitudes to mainstreaming. _Canadian
Journal of Special Education_, 5(1), pp. 1-14.* +
This author suggests that, while teacher attitudes are one of the most
powerful factors affecting the success of mainstreaming, much of the
existing research in this area is conflicting or inconclusive. More work
is needed around the implications of labels used for students with
handicaps, and around mainstreaming practices, instruments for measuring
attitudes, and the degree to which reseach on attitudes can be
generalized.

*Hill, J.L. (1988). Integration in Canada: Implications for the
certification of regular education teachers (RETS).
_Canadian Journal of Special Education_, 4, pp. 123-131.* +
The author presents the results of a survey of deputy ministers of
education and directors of special education across Canada regarding
certification requirements for teachers to work with children with
special needs. Two jurisdictions required completion of a course in
special education by regular teachers. No province or territory required
practicum experience with students with special needs.
