//you don't get somebody ready for something. <-- page 135
You have to start the person where they are. For example, getting a student
ready for Grade 5 math is ridiculous. [The teacher] should be thinking,
"`What is it that I want these kids to learn and how can I bring them to
that point?`" I guess what I'm really saying is: Grade 5 teachers are not
maching Grade 5 math, but they are teaching math to Grade 5 students. The
teacher has to decide who those students are and where they are in terms
of mathematics.

==== THE CHALLENGES AND REWARDS
The job of an M&R teacher is challenging in many ways. first and foremost,
M&R teachers feel they never have enough time to do everything that needs
to be done. Program planning, materials preparation and completing the paperwork
associated with IEPs and other documents interferes with their ability to
get into classrooms to observe and monitor student progress. M&R teachers
recognize that they should spend several hours at a time in the classroom
but usually only find time to observe for ten minutes to a half hour. As
a result, most methods and resource teachers depend to a great extent on
the reports of teachers and feedback from teacher's aides.

Methods and resource teachers suggest that there are serious problems with
classroom teachers expecting too much of their students with disabilities.
M&R teachers must work very hard to see that teachers have realistic expectations
and that students don't experience frustration and failure.

While teachers`' expectations tend to be too high, parents of students who
have spent a number of years in segregated settings often need encouragement
to have higher expectations for their children. M&R teachers report that
the parents seem reluctant to take risks with their child's placement, putting
tight limits on program alternatives. When there is a great gap between
the M&R teacher's judgement and the expectations of the classroom teachers
and parents, development of an appropriate instructional program becomm
very difficult.
