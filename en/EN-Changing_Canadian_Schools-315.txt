commitment to the unconditional inclusion of all children in the regular
classroom and the provision of appropriate individualized supports.

Common misunderstandinsg, goals and practical step for integration are
outlined in five sections: 1) the family's expectations; 2) enlisting
the help of the neighbourhood school principal; 3) enrolling the teacher;
4) involving classmates; and 5) the making of action plans (MAPs). The
placement of an integration consultant or facilitator in the school is
advocated.
