==== WHAT IS THE JOB OF THE METHODS AND RESOURCE TEACHER?

*_Helping Teachers_* +
"`Why don't you ask me for help?`" the methods and resource teacher asked
the Grade 12 English teacher who was complaining about having no materials
for e student with a low reading level. Teaching has been described as a
"`lonely profession`"; the English teacher is, like many of his colleagues,
reluctant to ask for help, even when it is available. As integretion of
students with special needs proceeds, however, many teachers are beginning
to ask for help. As one M&R teacher commented:

[quote]
____
If the classroom teachers are to get this student involved in the class,
they need help. I get materials together that the student can do in the
class, things the teacher can use with the student.
____

M&R teachers basically respond to the needs of teachers, and, as with the
English instructor, they most frequently help with materials, particularly
for reading, language arts and math.
