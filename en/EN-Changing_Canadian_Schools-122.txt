===== Training
M&R teachers generally said they thought personal and process skills that
underlie the work of the M&Rteacher should be present when the position
is assumed. Organizational and interpersonal skills, as well as a sensitivity
to student's needs and the determination to solve problems, are all things
that are difficult to teach.

Specific skills related to completing assessments, writing IEPs and developing
curriculum howledge are more easily acquired on the job. A commitment to
personal development and self-improvement is obviously a great advantage
to someone working as a methods and resource teacher:

I've had some special education training, but everything else I've had to
learn on my own. I've had to learn how to integrate students, how to define
their needs and how to have their needs met. I've had to learn course curriculums
so that I can modify them. I've had to develop my own system of modification.
The best training is experience. That's the only way. You don't develop
an intuitive feeling about something unless you've had experience doing
it. I've learned most of what I do day-to-day on the job.

When school districts 28 and 29 instituted the position of M&R teacher,
a normal training plan was developed. It included individual work with
teachers and half-day or full-day group training sessions held every other
week. Outside consultants have been used on occasion, but most of the training
has been carried out by district staff including the original methods and
resource teachers themselves.

Training focuses on developing an understanding of the philosophy of an
integrated program and the role of the M&R teacher in supporting the program.
Training in collaborative skills is particularly useful as these skills
are critical in establishing the right relationship with the classroom teacher.
