that any pupil whocan su%M'ully ﬁght his way intoaregular

regular classroom from the beginning. That was certainly the
case with our son.
A further danger is that, though cm @n model is
clearly segregationist, some people claim it is an integration
mobl. This enables people in school systems to claim to
support integration by supporting the Cascade rowel when in
fact they support segregation and rejection. The Cascade
model also encourages and rewards teachers who reject pupils
whose educational needs they cannot or will not meet. The
teacher fails the pupil, so the pupil is thrown out of the class
and becomes someone else’s problem. The model's emstence
also continues to waste scarce resources on segregation that
would be better spent on true integration.
Early in the move towards integration, well-meaning
administrators promoted the Cascade model, no doubt
because it represented advanced special education theory. The
support waned when its segregatiouist nature bwame
obvious. However, the model can be made to sound reasonable
and protective, and its ideological underpinnings are not
always evident, making it the most dangemus weapon in the
spedal education arsenal. It will continually appear like a
deadly virus and we must be on our guard against it.
