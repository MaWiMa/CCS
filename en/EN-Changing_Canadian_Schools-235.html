<h4 id="_conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tom Skrtic (1991) has criticized education systems for their rigidity and
inability to be truly adaptive to the needs of students. He advocates that
schools must operate as adhocracies where both students and teachers work
in a collaborative manner, applying their unique strengths to the problems
of the group, and pooling their resources to come up
with novel and innovative ways to meet student needs.</p>
