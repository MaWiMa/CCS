Once a person has access to education, which is said to be
available for all, it then follows that the student´s personal

What realities challenge the myth tht education is equi-
table? It has been shown over and over again that the quality
of education vmies ﬁngmﬁcantly fmm one school M another,

on how holy a child approximates the ideal student on which

Curriculum is usually bi on the prmumpticn that the
child’s intellectual “raw matter’, outlined in popular

In cultivating these intellectual properties, the purpose M‘

the same potential topop, for many reasons. Even if all kernels
are subjected to the same mnditions of heat, oil and distribu-
tion in the pot, they will not necessarily pop in an identical
manner.
The self-fulﬁlling prophesy inherent in this process should
not be overlooked. When it is argued that a supposedly fair
spectrum of qualities will be targeted in education, and when
students rise to thm htations, there is an illum‘on that
people are being educated properly and that people who fail
are legitimately failures. The structure of the process makes
