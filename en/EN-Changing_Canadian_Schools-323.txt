Parents who had previously experienced a resource room approach indicated
that they were satisfied with both integrated placement or resource room
placement for academic progress but were significantly more satisfied with
the integration option for their child's selfesteem and opportunity to
make friends.

This study tentatively concludes that children served by an integrated
classroom model have a better opportunity to blend succesfully into the
classroom than children who go out to a
resource room.

This is a report of a study comparing the effects of a full-time
mainstreaming approach for handicapped students with a
resource room approach for similar students. Results suggest that the
full-time mainstreaming approach, known as the Adaptive Learning
Environments Model, exceeds the resource room approach in attaining
desirable classroom processes, and in enhancing student attitudes and
achievement in basic skills.

This article supports the feasibility of restructuring regular education
programs to much more adequately serve students with diverse learning
characteristics and needs. Many of the students in question are currently
served by compensatory and special education pull-out programs.
