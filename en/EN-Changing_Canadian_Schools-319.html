<p>One paper outlines four learning opportunities available to students with
handicaps in integrated regular classes: 1) learning to interact with
peers; 2) learning to participate in typical routines; 3) learning
lifelong skills; and 4) learning about subjects not related to functional
life skills.</p>

These are the stories of two children, one in Grade 2 and one in Grade 8,
who are in fully integrated, individualized programs in schools in
Hamilton, Ontario. The cooperative roles of the regular classroom teacher
and special education resource teachers and aides are discussed. Forest
maintains that the key issue in integration implementation is the
&#8220;desire to do so&#8221; and not the need for money, resources or special
equipment.</p>

Two children with severe handicaps are successfully integrated into a
primary classroom. Their teacher describes her own learning process that
led her to conclude that &#8220;their needs were the needs of all children&#8221;
and &#8220;my own fear was the major problem.&#8221;</p>
