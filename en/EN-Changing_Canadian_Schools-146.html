<p>Special educators need to ensure that the general effort to improve instruction
includes factors relevant to students with special needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will be necessary to advocate for sufficient resources to carry out an
inclusionary program. Class size has a definite effect on the ability of
teachers to meaningfully integrate students with special needs. A class with
twenty-five students including one with special needs is much more manageable
than one with thirty-four students. Ongoing training is required for both
regular teachers and M&amp;R teachers. A sufficient number of M&amp;R teachers need
to be provided as well as teacher&#8217;s aids and other consulting professionals.
Integration is not a way to reduce the cost of special education. It is a
way to enrich the quality of education for <em>all</em> students.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s important that those responsible for the program resist being
dogmatic or defensive. They need to be open and receptive to constructive
suggestions to improve both the policy and practice of the model. New ideas
need to be incorporated into the plan as it goes along. The opinions of those
participating must be respected, and flexible responses developed to deal
with new situations. Integration must be seen as consistent with providing
better education to all students.</p>
