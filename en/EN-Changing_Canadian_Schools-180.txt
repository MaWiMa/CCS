*_Strategies for One-on-One Attention_* +
The following strategies call on various resources and tactics to
enable the teacher to focus more  time on each student.

The first resource is the para-professionals in the education system:
teacher's aides, assistants, and trained volunteers. The teacher can
ask this other adult to handle the class, which may be working on an
assignment prepared by the teacher, while the teacher works with an
individual student.
Or the teacher may ask the aide to work with the individual student
on a task again prepared by the teacher.

The second source of help is the children themselves. It is a wise
teacher who realizes he or she is not the only instructor in the
classroom. Peer tutoring is a growing practice not only within a
class but across grade levels as well. One of the wonderful things
about children is that they do not see the limitations of other
children. They are compassionate and passionate at the same time. The
most umnotivated student turns into a zealot when asked to help
another student. A word of caution: monitor the tutoring so that
the time spent is meaningful to both parties.

Another strategy is to design activities for the whole class which
free the teacher for short blocks of time to work with an individual
student. Again, the activity should he worthwhile for students, but
one which requires only minimal interaction with the teacher.

A fourth strategy is parental support. It is important to choose
parents who have a strong commitment to their involvement. Working
with small groups in the classroom, a parent can add a warm and
caring touch that all children enjoy and many children need.

*_Creating a Community Atmosphere_* +
To work well, a class has to be a cohesive unit which pulls together
for the benefit of all students. It is the teacher's responsibility
to promote a feeling of community and an appreciation of the
differences which make up that community.
