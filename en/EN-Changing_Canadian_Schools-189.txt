Some parents are very involved in setting goals for their children, wanting
their children to be included in regular programs and activities as much
as possible.

The IEP is generally written with both short and long term goals and may
be adjusted frequently. If something in the program is not working, the
classroom teacher and M&R teacher revise the program. Flexibility is
important.

*Assistance through various stages:* Regular classroom teachers of children
with special needs almost always need assistance in modifying programs
and instruction. The methods and resource teacher is a strong support in
these areas.

The M&R teacher helps select appropriate materials, and organizes them so
they can be used effectively. The classroom teacher keeps the M&R teacher
informed on the usefulness of the materials.

The M&R teacher helps the classroom teacher to identify the student's
learning style; using this information, he or she helps select the best
methods of teaching the student. He or she may even help out in the classroom
when the regular teacher first puts a new, specialized program into action.
In some cases, the M&R teacher may work in the classroom with the student
on an ongoing basis to meet the student's needs.

The classroom teacher implements the programs or methods recommended by
the M&R teacher, and reports any success or failure. If the M&R teacher
has been working one-on-one with the student in the classroom, the classroom
teacher watches and discusses the strategies and methods in order to carry
them over into other classroom activities.

Together the M&R and classroom teachers decide on evaluation procedures
where appropriate and organize a schedule for evaluation. The classroom
teacher does any testing and keeps a record of procedures used. The test
results are used as a guide in revising the IEP if needed.
