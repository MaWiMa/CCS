This article asserts the importance of in-service training for
regular classroom teachers as an important component for successful
mainstreaming. It also points out the need for more data collection and
research on this topic. Guidelines are presented for in-service training
methods, format, content, needs assessment, goals and objectives,
scheduling, evaluation, school administration and instructional materials.

children with handicaps in the regular classroom. Sections address
assessment, teaching and teamwork, cognitive development, language and
