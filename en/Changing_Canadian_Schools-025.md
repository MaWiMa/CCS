~~scheduled to take their case to court.~~ However, counsel for the
school board approached the Robichauds about agreement on
a settlement, and, like the Elwoods, the Robichauds were able
to reach agreement only days before their case was to be heard
in court. The settlement provided that Nathalie Robichaud,
like Luke Elwood, receive instruction in a regular classroom in
a neighbourhood school with non-disabled peers. Unfortunately, 
the Robichauds, like the Elwoods, were left respensible for 
their legal expenses while taxpayeres covered the costs
incurred by the school board and their administrators.  
The Robichauds were forced to turn to the courts because
New Brunawick´s francophone school boards and the
francophone division of the department of education have been
perceived as taking a more traditional approach to integration.
The *Enoncé de principe sur l’intégration scolaire*, developed by
department officials and issued to school boards,
provides for a "continuum of service" based on the Cascade
model mentioned above. It is most often interpreted to mean
that a student may be integrated only when it is clear the
student can "benefit" from the class. In other words, the
burden of proof rests with the student who must show "readiness"
for integration (Department of Education, 1988b).  
Both the Robichauds and the Elwoods began their legal
appeals after the equality rights provisions of the Canadian
*Charter of Rights and Freedoms* came into effect in 1985. *The
Charter* provided them with a legal basis for their demands
that had not existed previously (Bales vs. Board of School
Trustees, 1984). Since both case were settled out of court,
their resolutions do not have the weight of court decisions.
However, the fact that two different school boards in two
provinces capitulated completely to parent demand at the
eleventh hour seems to indicate their expectation that, faced
with the *Charter*, they would lose in the courtroom. Additional
litigation by parents in the coming decade will be newary to
establish clear jurisprudence in this contentious area.
