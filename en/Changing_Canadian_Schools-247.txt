Peer Modelling
Another powerful technique which requires less preparation
than peer ‘tutoring is peer modelling. In this situation, a
stuknt models for another classmate how to perform an
activity or skill. For example, one stuknt might show his

the teacher ﬁrst nmds to model the procwum for the non-
disabled student. Often, however, students spontaneously

A high school computer temher described how a capable
stuknt voluntarily spent time in class with Todd, a non-
verbal and overly timid classmate. Todd was often obsez; ved
standing back from the other students with his arms held up
tight amt his chest, wringing his hands. The student
worked with Todd, teaching him how to use a simple computer
mom. As weeks passed and opportunitim for exchanges
between Todd and his computer partner were maximized,
'l‘odd’s classmates noticed him showing more interest in com-
municating with and being around other students and teach-
ers during the day. He still stood apart from his peers often, but
he now exhibited a more relaxed body posture. The speech
pathologists and teachers then reviewed their efforts to en-
courage Todd in his attempts to speak, identifying additional
strategies to build his new-found conﬁdence. Meanwhile, the
computer student was challenged by her involvement with
Todd. On her own, she designed several other computer
programs for him, which were later entered in the district
Science Fair.
