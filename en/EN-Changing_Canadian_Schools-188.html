<p><strong><em>Methods and Resource Teachers</em></strong>
No matter how experienced, enthusiastic or determined teachers might be,
they will find their roles easier if there is someone to help. Methods and
resource (M&amp;R) teachers
<a href="/CCS/en/EN-Changing_Canadian_Schools-110.html">(see Chapter 8)</a>
are, first and foremost, experienced classroom teachers who have received
additional training in areas such as student assessment, Individual Education
Plans (IEPs) and multilevel instruction. They provide the teachers with
assistance in: assessment, planning, instruction and evaluation for students
with special program needs. An important working relationship exists between
the classroom teacher and the methods and resource teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> A student with special needs is usually identified upon
entry into the school system, and, as that student moves through the system,
his or her file is updated frequently. If new problems or circumstances
arise, the teacher gathers information on the child and consults with the
M&amp;R teacher. At this point, the M&amp;R teacher reviews the program needs of
the student and decides if new or further assessment is necessary. It is
important to note that much of the assessment is done through observation
rather than formal testing. The M&amp;R teacher reviews the information and
makes recommendations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Program adjustment:</strong> The M&amp;R teacher and the classroom teacher develop
an IEP for the student which includes recommendations from the assessment.
Together they modify the regular program or develop special programs to
meet the student&#8217;s needs.</p>

<p>Parents are frequently asked for their input, as it is imperative that
home and school focus on similar goals.</p>
