The training approach used relies on collaboration among teachers in
developing and sustaining multi-level instructional strategies. A
collaborative team approach allows teachers to share ideas and support
colleagues who are feeling the stress of having to meet diversified needs
that they may not feel equipped to handle. There is no time limit for the
completion of training, as it must be an ongoing process that allows for
differing rates of acceptance of change by teachers.

==== CONCLUSON
Because teachers are now responsible for a greater diversity of students
in regular classrooms, a wider range of teaching strategies is needed to
meet the needs of these students. As the integration of students with special
needs has evolved, inclusion has become a major concern. Multi-level
instruction is a teaching method which allows teachers to meet the individual
needs of students and provide quality education for all. This will not be
easy to do, nor will it happen quickly. However, if inclusion of all is
to be a characteristic of the education system in the future, there must
be commitment to the development of multi-level instruction. That will
require a commitment to the ideology and a commitment to providing the
resources needed for its implementation. Both students and the education
system will achieve a higher level of success as a result.
