<p>Even then it should be used only for compelling reasons necessary to meet
the child&#8217;s needs:</p>

<p>I have nothing against a student leaving the classroom for a short period
of time to meet an individual need.
And that goes right through from the multiply handicapped to the most gifted
students in our schoola. Everybody has individual needs, and if we can meet
them by withdrawing the child from class, or giving them an alternative from
time to time, then there is nothing wrong with that. However, that&#8217;s only
the case if it doesn&#8217;t interfere with the child&#8217;s self-esteem. I think that
pull-out should be done cautiously and as little as is necessary.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individualized instruction in class is the alternative to the pull-out approach.
This may be done by the teacher, the teacher&#8217;s aide, or by the M&amp;R teacher
coming into the class:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At present, we haven&#8217;t had to use pull-out very much. But in essence, our
teacher&#8217;s aides have been ping into the class and providing individual
instruction. [They] don&#8217;t work with the child in a seperate group, but within
the classroom. And I think it should happen in the classroom, because then
the teacher realises what&#8217;s happening with the child and can have some input.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The M&amp;R teachers interviewed disagreed with the concept of out-of-class
instruction as a way of making students &#8220;ready&#8221; for regular classroom
instruction:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teachers talk about readiness, which I think is a myth. You don&#8217;t get ready
to learn something. You can advance children&#8217;s interest, by trying to get
them involved, but you don&#8217;t get somebody ready for something.</p>
