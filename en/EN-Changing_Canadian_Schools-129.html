<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teacher&#8217;s aides play an important part in the integration of students with
disabilities. The M&amp;R teacher sets priorities and allocates the teacher&#8217;s
aide&#8217;s time, and also sees that the classroom teacher takes responsibility
for the teacher&#8217;s aide&#8217;s work in the classroom. The teacher&#8217;s aide must
not be seen strictly as a tutor for the student with disabilities, but as
someone to help in any number of ways to facilitate the general operation
of the classroom.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The teacher&#8217;s aide is responsible to the teacher,not to the M&amp;R teacher
while in the classroom. So it&#8217;s up to the teacher, once the program is
initiated, to make sure that the teacher&#8217;s aide knows what she wants her
to do.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers must include teacher&#8217;s aides in planning strategies for students.
Since teacher&#8217;s aides are in the classroom with the student, they often
have insights and information that can contribute to the problem-solving
task. At the high school level, teacher&#8217;s aides are used to support students
as they go to regular classes throughout the school. They also play a major
role in community access and employment programs for students with severe
disabilities. Teacher&#8217;s aides are most often the staff member to accompany
a student on work placements. In situations where there is only one M&amp;R
teacher in the school, the teacher&#8217;s aide is a source of moral support
for the teacher: &#8220;It helps a lot, having a teacher&#8217;s aide, because then
you&#8217;re not there all by yourself. At least you have somebody else there
who knows how hard you&#8217;re working.&#8221;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>M&amp;R teachers view parents in much the same way they do regular class teachers.
They recognize that parents are critical to students&#8217; success in school,
so they must cooperate with and involve parents. However, like teachers,
parents bring unique personalities and levels of expectation to the relationship.</p>
