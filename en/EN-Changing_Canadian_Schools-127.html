<p>The fact that I&#8217;ve only been teaching a few years is, I think, in some ways
a help. I can say to the more experienced teachers, &#8220;Well, how would you
handle this problem?&#8221; It&#8217;s almost an internship where we&#8217;re constantly
exchanging ideas. There&#8217;s a lot of feedback. I&#8217;ve prevented the teachers
with an idea and had them say, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;ve done this for a couple of weeks
and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s working.&#8221; So we pitch in and try something else.</p>

<p>In the high school and, to a lesser extent, the junior high, students typically
see a teacher for only one period, which creates problems in the consultation
process. Effective group meetings can be especially useful here:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did an assessment on a learning disabled student who moved into the district.
When we had the case conference all the teachers were together, except one,
and it was a very effective meeting. They were cooperative and everybody
now has a much better handle on this student.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attention to detail goes a long way in making the consulting role work.
For example, it helps to hold meetings at the teachers&#8217; convenience:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think you have to be a little more careful with the teacher who&#8217;s &#8220;bucking&#8221;.
I know that the little things count. If I wanted to meet with a teacher,
I would try to arrange a convenient time for that teacher. I would go so
far as to arrange the meeting in the smoking staff room if that&#8217;s what
they wanted and I&#8217;d make coffee ahead of time and have everything ready
so it was pleasant meeting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned never to lose my temper. I will hold it back.
I may spout off afterwards [to another M&amp;R teacher], but I will not let
the [classroom] teacher see that I am upset or frustrated.</p>
