<p>Parents have invariably had a deep feeling of malaise both about the
prospect and the reality of special education. This has been true even
when parents have had no clear conception of why this is so and how it
might be changed.
<a href="/CCS/inclusion/StigmaGoffman1963.pdf">Goffman (1963)</a>
has provided a thorough description of the underlying factors that

<p>Our experience with special education goes back to 1976. We have seen at
first hand the damage the segregated school system has done to some
students, particularly those with severe handicaps. The system was based
on the negative, stressing the students&#8217; differences and inabilities.
Special education teachers have told us repeatedly that our daughter
Yvonne &#8220;does not understand&#8221;, "`is not able to &#8230;&#8203; `", "`will never be
able to &#8230;&#8203; `", and so on. The turning point came about five years ago with
the recognition that although our daughter will probably always need
assistance in daily living, the most important element in her life will
be friends and the ability to communicate with them. It has taken a
number of years for educators to understand the importance of this.</p>

<p>The only time in my son&#8217;s life that he was segregated was in our school
system. It is not the only time he has learned; he has learned much as a
member of the YMCA, at various jobs, and in groups &#8230;&#8203; What this tells me
is that the segregation that was part of his educational upbringing,
unfortunately, was a learned response, it is not natural. It seems to me
that in an environment where we believe that [all] people should be treated
equally &#8230;&#8203; there is no place in our school system [for the] kind of
segregation &#8230;&#8203; being promoted through the Cascade model.</p>
