They can do this by arranging for teachers to visit classes where students
are successfully integrated, to read articles and books, to view videos
on integration, and to talk to students, parents, principals and teachers
who have had experience with the integration proccess.

One administrator said he finally understood what integration was all about
after reading Don Little's article, A Crime Against Childhood -- Uniform
Curriculum at a Uniform Rate: Mainstreaming Re-Examined and Redefined (1985).
A teacher said that after he saw CBC's The Journal documentary, Different
but Equal, he had a better understanding of parents`' reasons for wanting
integration. He indicated that he had been affected by this news story and
felt more motivated to make integration work. Even when school administrators
had no opportunity to personally prepare for integration, they said they
and their staff were still able to make a commitment. As one principal said,
"`Even before our school district developed their integration policies and
practices, I knew it was the right thing to do and my staff supported me.`"
Similarly, another educator stated, "`For me, it meant just saying to myself
and others, '`I'm going to try this and do my best!`'`"

*_Initiate Integration_* +
The educators involved in the provincial workshop could not agree on how
school administrators should first involve all their staff in the integration
process. Some principals thought that at first they should allow their staff
to volunteer to integrate an exceptional student into their classroom. Then
other teachers would have many opportunities for sharing, observing and in-service
training, and would become involved naturally. They felt this process would
allay initial teacher fears.

Other principals thought that all teachers on staff should be responsible
for integrating students with special needs right from the beginning.
