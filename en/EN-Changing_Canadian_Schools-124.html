<p>They suggest the need for greater individualization of the training with
less emphasis on whole group activities and more use of small groups established
on the basis of specific need, such as those of high school teachers. Insight
into actual experience through hands-on practise is a major training need
identified by M&amp;R teachers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the teachers saw areas they needed to learn more about including curriculum,
instructional techniques and the needs of individual children. Some expressed
confidence in their knowledge of regular classroom organisation and teaching
methods but felt they need more skill in assessment, testing and development
of appropriate individual plans for students. Another area in which many
felt inadequate was the development of multi-level instructional techniques
for use in the regular class.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Methods and resource teachers reported using a variety of strategies to
support regular class teachers while avoiding positioning themselves as
experts who provide easy answers to problems. They stressed the importance
of being seen as fellow-teachers and collaborators: &#8220;You can&#8217;t ask a teacher
to do anything you wouldn&#8217;t do yourself. You can&#8217;t be an expert. You have
to be one of them.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One strategy is to encourage the regular class teacher to take ownership
of both the problem and the plan to deal with it:</p>

<p>In September I thought I was going to do everything. I thought I was going
to be Miss Wonderful and do the programs for the teachers, be so much of
a help to them. Then I realized, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m doing all of this; they&#8217;re not
taking ownership; they&#8217;re thinking those kids are my problem.&#8221; So I had
to go back and re-adjust my way of doing things. I think it&#8217;s a lot better
now that I keep the role of the M&amp;R teacher focused on assisting and being
there to assist, but not doing everything.</p>
