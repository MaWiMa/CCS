behaviour to see her as a person who had a bad temper. As the
year  l‘1 students, instead of moving away from Sue
when she was “FF, drew close. When Sue was frustrated
with work, they would provide encouragement. When she was
angry they would stand near her. They had learned thatbeing
close helped her and, as one student joked, 'Ifshe went to hit
you, she oouldn’t hitas hardinclose.” Consequently, it was not
unusual to see a group of kids around Sue as they walked the
busy corridors to their next class.
At the end ofthe year, we interviewed some of the studenm
who had been with Sue. From these discussions some common
themes emerged:
1. The students liked making a commitment to Sue. (hat of
the twenty-ﬁve students who started, only two leﬂ. the
group. The students in the upport group saw students
who were not in the group as outsiders. When asked if they
felt it was a job they had to do, students replied, “No, it
wasn't. We were doing something for her,” and “No, it was
like being with anyone else in the class”.
2. They felt that they were oontributors to Sue and their
class. Students felt they were not asked oﬁen enough to
help other students in school. "We oould do a lot more if we
were given the chance,” one student said. “My mother says
that I am good with other kids. It’s something that I
already have.”
3. Most of the students derived satisfaction from their rela-
tionship with Sue. Her peers described the experience as
“fun because you get to laugh with Sue about things.”
Another student drew satisfaction fmm the experience,
saying, “It's nice when she says your name.” Students
commented on feeling bad when they were away from
school or had other commitments which prevented them
from being with Sue.
