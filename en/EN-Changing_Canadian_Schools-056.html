<div class="paragraph">
<p>When myths masquerade as reality, fact and fiction become inseparable.
It becomes difficult for most people to know what to believe and what not
to believe. In addition, any serious analysis of problems becomes
confusing, at best. This is the position we find ourselves in when we
look at the issue of integrated education for children with mental
handicaps. We have been led to believe in certain so called &#8220;truths&#8221;
about education in Canada. Because these have been presented as facts,
they are often used to obscure or discredit any serious discussion or
argument for integration in our public school system. In making a clear
and convincing case for education integration, the fallacy of these
&#8220;facts&#8221; must be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Popular debate over integrating children with mental handicaps into the
school system has been frequently couched in terms of four myths. The
first is that education is universal, that it is available to every
child in Canada without restriction. The second is that the available
education is equitable and equal for each child in the school system.</p>
