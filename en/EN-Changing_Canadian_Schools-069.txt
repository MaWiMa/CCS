_De facto_ segregation appealed natural and proper because of the numerous
examples of legally sanctioned state-approved discrimination.  

==== SEGREGATION AND THE EDUCATION ACT
Education for children with mental handicap has been, and continues to
be, a disturbing combination of both forms of segregation. In some
provinces, school acts made specific provisions for children with mental
handicaps to he educated in "`special`" schools and classrooms (_de jure_).
In other places the practice and policies of school boards has been to
treat children with disabilities as "`special`" and in need of a separate
educational program outside the regular classroom (_de facto_). However,
the _Charter_ and human rights legislation have provided parents with
powerful new weapons in the fight they wage daily on behalf of their
children to gain access to an equal education.  

===== The First Legal Challenges
In the first case to challenge segregated education, Mr. and Mrs. Balm of
British Columbia, on behalf of their son Arron, claimed that their school
board had failed to fulfil their educational duty of care when it exercised
its statutory power to decide to place the child in a segregated,
self-contained, special school on the basis that the child had a mental
handicap. The _Bales v. Central Okangan Board of School Trustees_ case
was framed in negligence because it took place before the equality rights
provision of _Charter_ came into force.  

The trial judge held that the _School Act_ did impose a duty on the school
board to provide sufficient school accommodation and tuition, free of
charge, to all children of school age. However, while the judge was
sympathetic to the evidence that integration was becoming the norm, he
followed the judidal tradition of legally sanctioning segegation. It is
notable that this
decision came prior to the existence of any constitutional protections
in Canada.
