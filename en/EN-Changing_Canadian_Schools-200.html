<p>For example, a student with very little written language might be expected
to be involved in the public speaking unit in the Language Arts program
at the junior or senior level. However, the expectation for his or her
presentation would be different from that of the other class members.
The student might be expected to do an oral presentation that is shorter
in length and based on a personel experience rather than on a topic that
has to be researched.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third step in the four-step process for multi-level instruction
is determining the method of student performance. The method of
performance that the student utilizes to show he or she understands
the concept taught should follow the same variations discussed under
method of presentation. There should be an allowance for assignments
based on varying modes of learning, assignments based on different
levels of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy, and assignments that show partial
participation. This will allow students who would not be able to
read a story, for example, to be taught the concept of setting and to
complete assignments to illustrate this understanding.
Assignments might be oral or written, or involve drawing or acting.
If the main objective is to have all the students understand setting,
it can be reached in many ways, all of which are equally valuable.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In allowing for different methods of student performance, perhaps the
most fundamental issue is the idea of choice. Students must be
allowed a variety of different ways to show that they understand a
concept. This involves an acceptance that the written word is not
the only way of expressing understanding. It also involves instilling
in students an acceptance that other ways of expressing understanding
of a concept are of equal value.</p>
