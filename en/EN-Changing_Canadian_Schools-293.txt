== The Roeher Institute Information Services Annotated Bibliography on Integrated Education

This annotated bibliography was compiled by Mary Ellen Mulligan for The
Roeher Institute. It contains a selection of additional resources
regarding the inclusion of students with disabilities in regular classes
in regular schools. The first section of the bibliography contains
material on the philosophical underpinnings of integration, the legal and
historical framework, and the human rights and advocacy issues. The second
part of the bibliography deals primarily with the "`howto's`" of
integration including administrative issues, teacher preparation and
practical strategies and models.

In compiling this bibliopaphy an effort was made to include the most
recent publications available on the subject:
most of the books and journal articles were published within the past
five years. Special consideration was given to highlight the situation in
Canada in regard to innovative policy and practice. Much of the material
listed in the bibliogaphy was drawn from the library of The Roeher
Institute. Many of the journals and monographs are also available from
educational institutions across the country.
