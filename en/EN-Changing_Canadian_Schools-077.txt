The equality requirement in the _Charter_ is intended to, and will
mandate, the inclusion of all children.
It will be interpreted by the courts as requiring the dismantling of
segregation. The power of parents to act on behalf of their children is
based on the child's constitutional and legal guarantees. Where the goal
is inclusion, the power of parents is inexhaustible. It will continue to
whittle away at the barriers that persist in practioe and in law. Those
who resist the inevitable transition to integation should recognize that
because the power of parents is exercised in the name of equality, it
will prevail.
