Although nine-year-old Sabrina was labelled autistic and severely to
profoundly retarded, she experienced remarkable progress in an
individualized program within a regular Grade 4/5 classroom. A major
concern of staff was the possible rejection of Sabrina because of her
anti-social behaviour. However, they found that a consistent approach
and the natural acceptance of her peers led to significant growth. This
article supports the view that school systems can and will change as
they see integration working.</p>

This article documents the experience of one school board in Ontario
which made a policy commitment to &#8220;move all children into their
neighbourhood schools with appropriate services.&#8221; Four schools&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;two
elementary and two secondary&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;initially served as models for the entire
system. The experiences of two students and their teacher/integration
facilitator are described. The authors pose the question, &#8220;If one board
can do it why can&#8217;t they all?&#8221;</p>
