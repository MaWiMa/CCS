*Lesson:* Math +
*Topic:* Recognition, Identification and Construction of Solids +
*Grades:* 2-5

When the concept of solids was introduced by the teacher, models were
given to all students to observe and manipulate. The student with a
visual impairment was allowed to manipulate the model for the entire time
the teacher was discussing the figure. When constructing a model of the
solid the teacher worked from this student's desk. As each step was introduced
the teacher assisted the child by showing her how to fold the paper and
by allowing her to feel it after each step. The child was able to see,
through touch, the flat sheet of paper turn into the desired model. This
technique could be used for teaching other concepts, such as perimeter,
area and volume. (Lois Wright, Joan Sheen, 1989)

==== SAMPLE LESSON THREE _ADAPTING LESSONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES_
A group of methods and resource teachers compiled a list of suggestions
for including students with disabilities -- both those with verbal skills
and those without verbal skills. They are suggestions geared to various
levels of disability and they range from simple techniques for involvement
at the verbal level to more complex ways of delivering instructions and
developing writing skills. They are listed in order of complexity under
verbal and nonverbal categories.

==== SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH VERBAL SKILLS:

. Have the student identify an object which is being used in the lesson.

. Use the student's name or a fact about that student in the lesson --
such as an article of clothing, a skill they have, or a physical feature.
