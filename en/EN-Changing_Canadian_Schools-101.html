<p>She replied, &#8220;No&#8221;. The person asked,&#8220;Well don&#8217;t you have Mandy?&#8221; The
Brownie leader&#8217;s response was, &#8220;Yes, but she doesn&#8217;t have special needs.
She&#8217;s just Mandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Integration has helped Mandy to see herself as part of the whole. Her
Grade 1 teacher told me that one day, during math class, Mandy suddenly
stood up and literally picked up her desk. She moved it from the last row
by the door to the front row in the middle of the classroom. At the beginning
of the period, the kids had been asked to move their desks into groups, but,
with good intentions, Mandy&#8217;s desk had been positioned so that she would
not have to move. As the teacher stood there speechless, a little boy at
the back of the class put up his hand and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be mad at Mandy,
she just feels left out.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We quickly realized what Mandy was trying to tell us through her actions.
In her own way she was showing us that although she was physically integrated
she still felt special or different, an outsider. The other kids recognized
this and spoke up on her behalf. Mandy&#8217;s desk remained in the middle of the
classrcom, in the front row, for the rest of the school year. The incident
also illustrates how Mandy&#8217;s participation has enhanced the other children&#8217;s
learning process, providing a creative, accepting, learning environment
for every child. In fact, all students have benefitted in many ways from
a unified school system in which all learning needs are readily addressed.
The supports and resources provided through integration, such as the methods
and resource teachers, teacher&#8217;s aides, peer tutors and cooperative learning
groups, are providing valuable assistance to all students in the classroom.</p>
