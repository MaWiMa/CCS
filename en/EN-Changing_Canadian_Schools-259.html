<p>Similarly, Brendtro and Ness (1983) discussed this phenomenon in schools
and the perceived monopoly by adults:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The increasing sophistication of human service professionals has given
rise to a myth and the belief that only those with high degrees of training
can be effective in teaching or treatment. Although it is commendable that
the emerging professions have sought to improve the qualifications of
practitioners, this emphasis has sometimes obscured the reality that young
people can, and usually do, have more influence on one another than do
adults.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facilitating peer relationships requires building and maintaining supportive
and caring relationships in which the person is valued as a separate and
unique individual, regardless of the perceived special need. Having friends
who value appropriate behaviour and behave as competent role models is
essential for most children, adolescents and young adults. In contrast,
being isolated from peers is one of the major symptoms of psychological
distress. Psychological distress can be the result of isolation (i.e.,
streaming students) or it can cause the isolation (i.e., students who
become lonely because of a lack of social skills). Influencing the peer
group may be one of the most important actions adults can take to ensure
that children who are distressed have an opportunity to become successful
and competent members of their peer groups.</p>

<p>Children with disabilities typically have not had the opportunity to
experience or develop a range of social relationships with their peers:</p>

<p>as a result, they spend inordinate amounts of time in solitary activities;
they spend excessive amounts of time with adult family members and paid
caregivers who
almost become unnaturally intrusive in their lives.</p>
