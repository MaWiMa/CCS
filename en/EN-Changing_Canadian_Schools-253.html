<p>Building ongoing friendships that extend outside school and into the
neighbourhood has been a challenge for teachers and families. Part of the
challenge is that friendship cannot be defined, analyzed, predicted or
assigned like school work.</p>

<p>Difficult as it is to define friendship, it is easy to describe why
friendships are important and how they enrich our lives.
They help us stretch beyond our families; they help children rehearse
adult roles; they are a haven from stress and they demystify strange and
inappropriate behaviour (Perske, 1988).

<p>Friendships expand our world and our perspectives; they are attractive
and generate their own energy; friendships are freely chosen and voluntary;
they are mutual and reciprocal, coming and going with intensity varying
over time. Friendships have their ups and downs, joys and pains, laughter
and tears (Pogrobin, 1987).</p>

<p>Some teachers become discouraged and doubtful when searching for ways to
help a student with disabilities make friends. They feel that &#8220;real&#8221;
friendships cannot exist between disabled and non-disabled people and that
efforts to encourage friendships are staged and phoney.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In actual fact, adults can overlook or misinterpret relationships that
exist between disabled and non-disabled students.
We must he careful not to impose a stereotypical image of how friendships
should look and therefore devalue budding friendships that have non-traditional
features. There have been some remarkable friendships between disabled
and non-disabled students.</p>

<p>Teachers in one school were truly amazed to hear about a student&#8217;s efforts
to visit his friend with a disability who was in
the hospital struggling with a life-threatening condition.</p>
