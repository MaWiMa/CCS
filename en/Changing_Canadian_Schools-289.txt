Ask students why they chose to go to college and they will
invariably mention the possibility of making new friends.
Some students might set a higher priority on getting a well-
paying and sauna job, others on getting a good edumticn, but
the social aspects are a very attractive feature of student life.
Many ﬁfe-long friendships trace their beﬂnning to meetings
at concerts, lecture halls and cafeterias on campus. Other
relationships fade when the cdlege years are over but are long
remembered as part of an important stage of personal growth
and discovery.
As students pursue their own interests, there are endless
possibilities for meeting other students with similar interests:
dancing at the monthly pubs; attending metry neadings in the
library; setting up the sound system for a conwrt or jam
session; at a quiet magaﬁne rack in the library or a music
listening corner. Whole aections of the cafeteria are devoted to
card games and homework; these are places where camarade-
rie and collaboration on assignments are encouraged. Orga-
nized opportunities to socialize also abound: at student council
fund-raising barbecues, aerobathons, and morale-boating
mid-winter madness escapada. The opportunities for per-
sonal development are an important part of the culture of
mlleges and universities.
