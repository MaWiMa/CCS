=== Transcript and Translation  
Since 5th of March 2013 I try to translate *Changing Canadian Schools* into german.
*Changing Canadian Schools* is a book from 1991 and I read it the first time in 2011 because of link:/inclusion/Inklusion.pdf[professional interest] on inclusion.
You can download the book from this site: http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED341224 under this link http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED341224.pdf[ED341224.pdf]. If the link is dead now, take link:/copies-from-original/BestCopy_Changing_Canadian_Schools_Perspectives_on_Disability_and_Inclusion.pdf[my copy], trust me, it is the same.
I split this copy into each page to go through translation side by side. For the copies I use only the front and back-cover of my book, the rest is from the source obove. If pages are numbered, they are signed out too, white pages are left out.

I guess now you can only buy it used, if you want your own hardcover, on April the 17th in 2013 I received mine.

If you want to work with me (or maybe later us), you only should know how to use http://git-scm.com/[git] and write http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[ascidoc].
It is all quiet simple, +
*if I can do this - anyone can!* +
You find the source on https://github.com/MaWiMa/CCS
.
All work can be done within a simple editor.

First I tried to do the work in a wiki with https://github.com/gollum/gollum/blob/master/README.md[gollum] at home, it is really lovely and simple do work with that software.
Now, after a time I did nothing on this stuff, I dicided not do do it through wiki. Everything should be done from now on with asciidoc(tor), with a static website for online-readers, and pdfs or epubs for those who like ebooks.
